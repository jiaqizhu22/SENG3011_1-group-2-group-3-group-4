Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.Polio is a highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis (approximately one in 200 infections) or death (approximately 2-10% of paralyzed cases). The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food).Two of the three types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1. Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The detection of WPV1 outside the two countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of WPV1.The risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (<80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than six years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 April 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 December 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.Additionally, the country is currently affected by tropical storm Ana which may impact the country\u2019s response capacity by impairing Polio SIAs and surveillance activities. According to the UN flash update on Malawi tropical storm Ana, as of 11 February, there have been 995 072 people affected in 19 districts, 206 people injured, 46 people reported dead, and 18 people are reported still missing. The United Nations and partners are supporting the life-saving emergency flood responseThe risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the significant population movement between Mozambique and Malawi, suboptimal vaccination coverage in the neighbouring countries, and suboptimal AFP surveillance activities.The risk at the global level is assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place and the moderately high global Polio coverage estimates.It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response.Under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), countries must investigate and notify any poliovirus isolate, whether the isolate is from AFP cases, AFP contacts or environmental surveillance. Local health authorities should initiate the investigation within 24 hours of a poliovirus isolate being reported.Isolation of poliovirus in a previously non-infected area represents an event or outbreak that requires national authorities to complete an immediate risk assessment to inform the type and scale of response. Following initial investigation and risk assessment, national authorities must continue to collect detailed information to update the situation analysis and risk assessment (i.e. results from laboratory investigations, or detailed information on affected communities, etc.). Neighbouring countries/regions must also continue to update their risk assessment with support from WHO regional offices.Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates (>90%) both at national and subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction. WHO recommends that two high-quality large-scale vaccination campaigns (>90% of children vaccinated) should be completed within eight weeks of laboratory sequencing results. A mop-up round might be required as an additional step wherever monitoring suggests children have been missed in certain health districts or areas, to ensure interruption of transmission (even in the absence of new poliovirus detections). Communication and social mobilization activities should be an integrated part of reactive Polio immunization campaigns.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to Malawi based on the information available for this current event. WHO\u2019s\u00a0International Travel and Health\u00a0recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of an\u00a0Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\u00a0 Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, consider vaccination of all international travelers, ensure such travelers are provided with an international certificate of vaccination, restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination, intensify cross-border efforts to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers, and intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage.Citable reference: World Health Organization (03 March 2022).

As of 18 February, three cases have been confirmed and one death has been reported. These are the first reported Lassa fever cases in the United Kingdom since 2009, and represents the second known case of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Europe.The first case travelled to Mali in late 2021, where Lassa fever is endemic. After returning to the United Kingdom, the individual developed symptoms of fever, fatigue and loose stool, and was subsequently hospitalized. The first case has now recovered. The second and third cases were family members of the first case and did not travel to Mali. Both were admitted to the hospital and the third case has sadly died.On 8 February, samples from both the first and second cases were laboratory confirmed positive for Lassa virus by PCR. The third case was initially provided care as a probable case of Lassa fever and the diagnosis was confirmed on 9 February.Incident responses have been activated by health authorities in the United Kingdom to coordinate the clinical and public health management of these cases.People with exposure to the cases were identified through robust contact tracing activities. Low and high risk contacts are being followed up for 21 days after their last exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis has been offered to high-risk contacts with the most significant exposures. Systems are in place to assess and manage any contacts who may develop symptoms during the follow up period.Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with infected Mastomys rats\u2019 urine or faeces. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions, particularly in health care settings. It can cause severe disease in about 20% of patients. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is 1% overall and 15% in severely ill patients. Early recognition and initiation of patient care decrease the CFR and public health impact.Lassa fever is endemic in Mali and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from countries in West Africa where the disease is endemic, such as Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia and Nigeria in recent years. However, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is known to be extremely rare when appropriate infection prevention and control precautions and laboratory biosafety measures are applied. The only secondary transmission of Lassa fever reported in Europe was in 2016 from Germany, when the secondary case performed post-mortem care of a fatal case.Human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles, as well as direct contact with bodily secretions. Health care workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, although information from recent imported cases in Europe show that secondary transmission of Lassa virus is rare when standard IPC precautions are followed. The possibility of additional secondary cases related to transmission in a health care setting cannot currently be excluded, but is considered very unlikely in the community.Prevention of Lassa fever in endemic countries relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. Family members and health care workers should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick individuals.In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard IPC measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, or handling their clinical specimens, should reinforce standard and contact precautions, comprising appropriate hand hygiene, rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, isolation, safe injections practices and safe burial practices. In order to avoid any direct contact with blood and body fluids and/or splashes onto facial mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) when providing direct care for a patient with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, personal protective equipment should include: 1) clean non-sterile gloves; 2) clean, non-sterile fluid resistant gown; and 3) protection of facial mucosa against splashes (mask and eye protection, or a face shield).Given the nonspecific presentation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, isolation of ill travellers and consistent implementation of standard and contact precautions is key to preventing secondary transmission. When consistently applied, these measures can prevent secondary transmission even if travel history information is not obtained, not immediately available, or the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever is delayed.There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.Considering the seasonal increases of cases between December and March, countries in West Africa that have endemic Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems to enhance early detection and treatment of cases, and to reduce the case fatality rate, as well as to strengthen cross border collaboration.Citable reference:\u00a0World Health Organization (21 February 2022).

Three states account for 82% of confirmed cases: Ondo (63), Edo (57) and Bauchi (53). The other states affected are Benue (11), Ebonyi (5), Oyo (5), Taraba (5), Kogi (4), Enugu (2), Kaduna (2), Cross River (1), Delta (1), Katsina (1) and Plateau (1) (Figure 2).Of the 211 laboratory confirmed cases, five cases have been reported among health workers in two states, Edo (3) and Benue (2).Figure 1.\u00a0Weekly number of reported confirmed Lassa Fever cases and deaths in Nigeria during the epidemiological weeks one (commencing 2 January) through four (commencing 23 January) in 2022.In contrast, noticeably less Lassa fever cases with less geographical spread were reported for the same period (epidemiological weeks 1- 4) in 2021 (54 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths, from 8 States).Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the annual peak of Lassa fever cases is typically observed during the dry season (December\u2013April). Thus, the number of infections is expected to rise further until the end of the dry season.While endemic in Nigeria, cases are much higher than the previous epidemic seasons. This could be attributed to reduced response capacity in surveillance and laboratory testing. It is necessary to continue to monitor the annual peaks of Lassa fever in order to contextualize incidence and inform the effective management of Lassa fever.Figure 2.\u00a0Confirmed cases of Lassa fever by States reported in Nigeria from 3 \u2013 30 January 2022Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces from Mastomys rats. Though to a lesser extent, secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health-care settings.As aforementioned, the peak of Lassa fever cases in humans typically occurs in the dry season (December-April) and follows the reproduction cycle of the Mastomys rats in the wet season (May \u2013 November). Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats\u2019 excreta) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in the rat population poses a risk for further human infection during the dry season.Approximately 80% of Lassa virus infections in humans are either asymptomatic or mild, however, infection in the remaining 20% manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio among all infected people is approximately 1% but is significantly higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness (around 15%).Timely diagnosis results in more rapid isolation of patients and provision of treatment, while also reducing the risk of person-to-person transmission in health care settings. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival of patients.The current overall risk is considered high at national level. While Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the country has developed an increased capacity for the prevention and control of Lassa fever outbreaks, including strengthened surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity, several factors contribute to the current elevated risk level. These include an increase in the number of confirmed cases compared to previous epidemic seasons, gaps in surveillance and varying degrees of subnational response capacity, delays in sample shipment for laboratory testing, a decrease of case management capacity due to conversion of dedicated Lassa fever facilities into COVID-19 health-care facilities and suboptimal IPC procedures. These factors combined warrant the need for further improvement and support of the country\u2019s capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks. In addition, the five confirmed cases among health workers, which included two workers caring for the same patient in the emergency ward, further emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures.The overall regional and global risk is considered low due to minimal cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighbouring countries. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in West African countries, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, but may exist in other countries in the same region.Mastomys\u00a0rats are the main reservoir for Lassa virus and so abundant in endemic areas in West Africa that it is not possible to eliminate them from the environment. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of waste far from the home, maintaining clean households and considering keeping cats. Precaution should be taken when handling Mastomys rats. \u00a0All animal products should be thoroughly cooked.Those caring for affected persons should be careful and avoid contact with blood and body fluids.In health-care settings, health workers and volunteers should apply standard infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for individuals, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials) and safe injection practices.Health workers caring for those with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the person\u2019s blood, body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 meter) of individuals with Lassa fever, health workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Personnel working in laboratories are also at risk. Samples taken from suspected Lassa fever cases for diagnostics should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.WHO continues to advise all countries endemic for Lassa fever on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria and the affected areas based on the currently available information.Citable reference:\u00a0World Health Organization (14 February 2022).

Following periods of lower transmission in 2019 and 2020, and amid the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, weekly notifications of suspected measles cases have been increasing in all provinces since the end of July 2021, with the highest weekly toll observed in the last four weeks in January 2022 (Figure 1). The number of cases and deaths increased by 18% and 40% respectively from week 4, 2022 (week commencing January 24) to week 5, 2022 (week commencing January 31).Figure 1. Weekly number of reported suspected measles cases in Afghanistan. Week 1, 2018 to week 4, 2022. Source: WHO Country Office in Afghanistan, WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.From 1 January 2021 to 29 January 2022, 35 319 suspected measles cases were reported in Afghanistan, of which 3221 (9%) were laboratory-confirmed by IgM-ELISA in the seven reference laboratories (one national and six regional). Most of the suspected measles cases (91%) occurred among children less than 5 years of age. During the same period, 156 measles deaths were reported among the confirmed cases (CFR=4.8%), with more than 97% of the fatalities registered among children less than 5 years of age. Although the number of deaths is relatively low, the rapid rise in cases suggests that the trend of reported deaths will continue to increase sharply in the coming weeks.The most affected provinces, with the highest number of reported cases (confirmed and suspected) are Balkh, Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kabul, Paktika, and Paktya. Figure 2 shows the measles notification rate (confirmed and suspected cases) per million population. The highest rates were observed in Paktya (617 cases per 1 000 000), Balkh (275 cases per 1 000 000), Kunduz (204 cases per 1 000 000) Zabul (168 cases per 1 000 000), Kandahar (145 cases per 1 000 000), Logar (127 cases per 1 000 000).Figure 2.

Unvaccinated young children are at the highest risk of measles and its complications (e.g. pneumonia and encephalitis), including death. Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics with a high case fatality rate, especially among young, malnourished children.Afghanistan is considered a fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable setting. The country has faced years of compounded crises, under-investment, instability and drought, and has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. According to UNICEF, 14 million people in Afghanistan are facing acute food insecurity, and an estimated 3.2 million children under five years suffer from acute malnutrition.The large and widespread outbreaks and the increasing number of reported measles cases in Afghanistan, is due to a variety of complex factors that on the one hand have resulted in the low immunization coverage of both first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2), on the other has exacerbated the impact of the outbreak (e.g. high levels of acute malnutrition, winter conditions and crowded domestic situation, previous displacement).\u00a0The 2020 WHO/UNICEF national immunization coverage estimates were 66% for MCV1 and 43% for MCV2. At the sub-national level, administrative coverage data shows that six provinces achieved less than 50% MCV1 coverage (Kandahar 40%; Paktya 38%; Jozjan 37%; Khost 36%; Helmand 18%; Urozgan 3.1%). The internal displacement of 698 000 people in 2021 was another driver of low MCV coverage. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) frequently live in conditions that increase susceptibility to measles (e.g. through less access to immunization services) and may increase measles exposures (e.g. through over-crowding) as well as experiencing poor health outcomes (e.g. due to factors like increasing risk and rates of malnutrition, poor access to curative services). Cross-border travel due to the recent instability in Afghanistan has increased the risk of international spread, particularly in Pakistan and Iran.Overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:The regional risk is considered moderate due to the movement of people to Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan, while at the global level the risk is considered low due to moderately high global MCV coverage estimates. More information is required from neighbouring countries and continued monitoring of displacement trends.Two-dose measles vaccination coverage of at least 95% in every province is recommended to ensure immunity. Strengthening routine immunization and conducting outbreak response immunization campaigns are essential for effective control of the epidemic and reducing mortality.The administration of vitamin A, particularly in the context of malnutrition, is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality.

There were 1451 reported cases and 10 deaths (CFR 0.7%) in 2020 and 901 cases and 11 deaths (CFR 1.2%) in 2021. In January 2022\nalone 1286 cases were reported, of which 790 (61.4%) were children under the age of 14 years, 142 were severe dengue cases and 20 fatalities were reported (case fatality ratio 1.6%). The majority of the cases who presented to the hospital were\ndiagnosed based on the clinical signs and symptoms. Dili municipality, which includes the capital city of Timor-Leste, reported the highest number of cases (857 cases 66.6%), followed by Manatuto municipality (92, 7.2%).Dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste year-round, with peak transmission reported from December to April during the hottest months of the year (Figure 1). The ongoing monsoon season may increase mosquito density and the likelihood of further transmission\nof dengue in the next few months. \u00a0In previous outbreaks between 2005 and 2012, two co-circulating serotypes, dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and dengue virus 3 (DENV-3), were reported. Information on circulating serotypes has not been available\nsince 2012.Figure 1. Dengue cases reported in Timor-Leste, 1 January 2016 - 31 January 2022Source: WHO Country Office in Timor-Leste, WHO Regional Office for South-East AsiaThe Ministry of Health has undertaken several response activities including:Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is caused by four DENV serotypes (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3 and DENV 4). Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes\u00a0albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri-urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes. Sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue.Although dengue in Timor-Leste is not unexpected, the significant daily increase in the number of dengue cases and the rate of hospitalization in the current outbreak are unusual. The number of reported cases between 1 December 2021 to 31 January 2022 is substantially higher compared to the same periods in previous years since 2016. As dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste, the population may be at risk of secondary infection and possible serious complications if not treated promptly and adequately.There is no specific treatment for dengue. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue cases. Given the limited health care capacity in-country, poor access to health care, and COVID-19 and other diseases pressuring health capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts and an increased number of severe and fatal dengue cases.\u00a0Co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and DENV can also be expected.Due to strict international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, cross-border movement of people is limited. However, international spread by vectors or asymptomatic travellers cannot be ruled out because Timor-Leste shares a land border with Indonesia where dengue is also endemic and the primary vectors are present.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better detection,\u00a0increased bed capacity in hospitals, sensitized\u00a0health care providers on case management\u00a0and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness to better assess disease burden and seasonality patterns. Establishing sentinel sites for systematically testing and subtyping dengue virus will support the detection and response to dengue in affected areas.The prevention and control of dengue depends\u00a0on effective vector control.\u00a0WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0subspecies, for larvae and adult mosquitoes.\u00a0Enhanced IVM involves removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure (i.e.,\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures).\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact such as residences, workplaces, schools and hospitals.\u00a0Vector control activities can include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis, as well as chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage. Community-led cleaning activities should be encouraged involving community groups, students, religious groups among others. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure.Although dengue is not spread from person to person, mosquitoes can become infected after it bites someone with DENV. This cycle, therefore, makes the infected mosquito capable of spreading dengue within the household and the neighbourhood leading to clusters of cases. During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0 While indoors, WHO recommends the use of mosquito repellents,\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Using window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Timor-Leste based on the information available for this event.Citable referenceWorld Health Organization (4 February 2022).

Borgou department, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported an increase in cholera cases from week 43 (ending on 31 October) to week 50 (ending on 12 December), with 841 cases reported, of which 71% of cases (n=597) were reported from Parakou district.CoordinationMonitoringLaboratory and case managementWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)Risk CommunicationLogisticsCholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0bacteria in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is a potentially serious infectious disease that can cause high morbidity and mortality, which can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting.Cholera is endemic in Benin and since 2016, cases continue to be reported every year in various departments across the country. The Parakou district in Borgou department is the epicenter of the current outbreak with high commercial traffic to Cotonou, the capital of Benin.The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in Benin include:Additionally, Benin shares international borders with Nigeria and Togo, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Given the porous borders with countries responding to cholera outbreaks and inadequate WASH conditions, the national and regional risks of this outbreak is assessed as high while the risk at the global level is considered to be low.WHO recommends improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, good food safety and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera.Strengthening surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improved access to care, should be implemented in areas affected by the outbreak to reduce mortality. There is a need to ensure that countries are prepared to rapidly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in areas with active cross border population movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Benin based on the information available on the current outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Cholera"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Benin", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/hepatitis-e-virus---chad", "date_of_publication": "2022-01-17", "headline": "Hepatitis E virus - Chad", "main_text": "As of 11 January 2022, 385 suspected cases of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been reported, of which, 12 are confirmed and two associated deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 0.5%) have been reported in six villages in Lai district, Tandjile region, Chad. Health authorities began an investigation on 1 October 2021 for a cluster of 25 suspected HEV cases presenting with jaundice, fever, and epigastric pain. Of the tested samples at the Ndjamena General Hospital, 65% (13/20)\u00a0 were positive for HEV using rapid diagnostic tests. The same batch of 20 samples was referred to the Centre Pasteur in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, a WHO collaborating centre for confirmation and 12 tested positive for HEV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results for blood samples from a further 29 of the suspected cases \u00a0remain pending.Of the 385 reported cases, more than half were male (n=215; 57%). Cases aged less than 10 years (n=90; 23.4%) and 21-30 years (n=89; 23.1%) accounted for the largest proportion of cases.Heavy rain in Chad since June 2021 have greatly impacted the Tandjile region and by October 2021, approximately 161 000 people were affected. Floodwaters caused substantial infrastructural damage in a setting that has pre-existing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) challenges such as a poor access to safe drinking water and high rates of open defecation.The last known outbreak of HEV in Chad began in August 2016 and lasted for 17 months before the Ministry of Health declared the end of the outbreak in February 2018. A total of 1874 suspected HEV cases and 23 associated deaths were reported. The area affected in this outbreak was located in the Salamat region, just over 700 km north east of the current outbreak.Suspected HEV cases have been detected in Chad after nearly four years without any reported cases. Heavy rains causing flooding have created favourable conditions for HEV transmission, including a large amount of displaced people living in precarious situations where clean drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services are limited.The main risks of spread at the national level are 1) poor sanitation and hygiene practices especially in areas affected by floods; 2) high rates of open defecation; 3) lack of access to safe drinking water; and 4) presence of large internally displaced population.At a regional level, the risk of HEV transmission is currently low. However, the risk may be affected by the increased number of displaced persons in Tandjile region and from other southern regions of the country, some of which share a border with Cameroon and the Central African Republic. HEV outbreaks are currently occurring in South Sudan and Sudan, however no epidemiological links have been established with the outbreak in Chad. During the last documented outbreak in Chad which ended in 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in South Sudan showed HEV genotype 1, sub-genotype 1e, that was closely related to strains isolated in Chad and Uganda.Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the HEV. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas with humanitarian emergencies.HEV is transmitted mainly by the faecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2\u20136 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, which can be fatal. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimester, putting pregnant women at increased risk of acute liver failure, foetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality ratio can be as high as 20-25% in the last trimester of pregnancy.There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E other than general management of acute liver failure as needed, and supportive care. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required.Prevention is crucial against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV are provision of safe drinking water, and provision of adequate water and sanitation hygiene. At the individual level, risk of infection can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following other WHO hygiene practices for food safety. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources, along with community engagement should be increased in conjunction with other sanitation interventions in an aim to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene.Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat HEV epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings.As the incubation period for HEV ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe WASH promotion have been adopted.It remains important that interventions continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries.A hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risks, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Chad or any of the affected countries based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Hepatitis E virus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Chad", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/influenza-a-(h5)---united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland", "date_of_publication": "2022-01-14", "headline": "Influenza A (H5) - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "main_text": "On 6 January 2022, the International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified WHO of the detection of a laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5) from South West England.The case lived with a large number of domestically kept birds which had onset of illness on 18 December 2021, and subsequently tested positive with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) by the United Kingdom National Reference Laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge laboratory.\u00a0 As part of routine follow up of exposed persons to avian influenza cases, an upper respiratory swab was taken from the case on 24 December 2021 which tested positive for influenza A with subtyping H5. Further characterization of the virus is ongoing. This result was reproduced on two successive upper respiratory swabs collected during the following days. The case has remained clinically asymptomatic and is now considered to not be infectious.Following successful virus isolation from samples collected from birds on the infected premises, APHA analyzed full genome sequence data for the HPAI A(H5N1) virus present in these birds. Genomic analysis demonstrated that the sequence generated contained no strong correlates for specific increased affinity for humans.All contacts have been identified and managed according to the national public health protocols. None of the contacts have reported symptoms and no evidence of secondary transmission has been identified to date.The infected premises were visited by APHA personnel who completed culling of all the birds. Several measures including complete decontamination and cleaning of the outside of the property have been completed.A three-kilometer captive bird (monitoring) controlled zone was declared by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs around the infected premises. The zone will remain in place for at least 21 days following the completion of preliminary cleansing and disinfection and will not be lifted until surveillance activities including clinical inspections of all commercial premises in the\u00a0zone have been undertaken.Since 2003, a total of 863 cases and 455 deaths of influenza A(H5N1) human infection have been reported worldwide, including this case in the United Kingdom. The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in October 2020 in Lao People's Democratic Republic in a one-year-old female who had exposure to backyard poultry (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 17 November 2020).Since 1 October 2021, there have been 73 poultry cases and 471 detections in individual wild birds of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1)This is the first reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5) infection in the United Kingdom. The case remained clinically asymptomatic. The virus has not been detected beyond this single case. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate.There are no specific vaccines for preventing Influenza A(H5N1) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report (for more details, please see Case definitions for the four diseases requiring notification in all circumstances under the International Health Regulations (2005)).In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in specific high-risk activities such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment. All persons involved in these activities should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should also follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade with the United Kingdom based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Influenza A (H5)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Kingdom of Great Britain ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Northern Ireland", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---west-and-central-africa", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-23", "headline": "Yellow Fever - West and Central Africa", "main_text": "In 2021, nine countries in the WHO African Region (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Republic of Congo,) reported human laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF) in areas that are at high risk for the disease and have a history of YF transmission and outbreaks. These outbreaks are growing in case numbers, necessitating an urgent response.Since the beginning of 2021 and as of 20 December, there have been 300 probable and 88 laboratory confirmed cases of YF. Among the probable cases there have been 66 deaths reported\u00a0from six\u00a0countries (Ghana = 42; Cameroon = 8; Chad = 8; Nigeria = 4; Congo = 2; DRC = 2), the overall case fatality ratio (CFR) among the probable cases is 22%, with a very wide variation among countries e.g Ghana (40%) and Cameroon (21%).In October and November 2021, confirmed active YF outbreaks were reported in Ghana and Chad respectively and required support from the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for vaccine provision from the emergency global stockpile of YF vaccine.Among the affected countries some are classified as having a fragile, conflict-affected or vulnerable (FCV) setting, in addition to low YF population immunity. Gaps or delays in investigations of suspected YF cases due to insecurity (Chad, Cameroon, CAR) or under-served (nomadic) communities (Ghana) have implications for harm to human health and risk of onward amplification and spread.The situation is also concerning where cases have been confirmed in inaccessible health districts with weak YF surveillance, preparedness, and response systems, and significant population displacements into neighbouring countries (e.g., Cameroon, Chad, CAR). In addition, there are major urban areas such as Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire that have reported YF cases and are a high concern as they pose a significant risk of amplification mediated by Aedes aegypti person-mosquito-person transmission (without sylvatic intermediary). Urban YF outbreaks can rapidly amplify with onward spread internationally, as seen in Angola and DRC in 2016. The case count of confirmed and probable cases is rapidly evolving and has challenges to track due to the complexity of interpretation in the context of available epidemiological and clinical data, including vaccination history of the cases.The overall YF vaccination coverage in these regions is not sufficient to provide herd immunity and prevent outbreaks. Estimates from WHO and UNICEF in 2020 on routine YF vaccination coverage was 44% in the African region, much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer herd immunity against YF. The national coverage in the countries of concern were all under 80% with the exception of Ghana (88%): Congo (69%), Cote D\u2019Ivoire (69%), Niger (67%), Cameroon (57%), DRC (56%), Nigeria (54%), CAR (41%), and Chad (35%). These low YF vaccination coverages indicate the presence of an underlying susceptible population at risk of YF and a risk of continued transmission.These outbreaks are occurring in a large geographic area in the West and Central regions of Africa. These reports signal a resurgence and intensified transmission of the YF virus. The outbreaks have included areas that have previously conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaigns but with persistent and growing gaps in immunity due to lack of sustained population immunity through routine immunization and/or secondary to population movements (newcomers without history of vaccination). For example, outbreaks were identified in late 2020 in countries with a history of nationwide preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) including an outbreak in Guinea notified in November 2020 (history of PMVCs 2005, 2010) and Senegal notified in November 2020, (history of PMVCs 2007 plus reactive campaigns in 2011, 2005, 2002). In 2021, the recently confirmed outbreak in Ghana is marked by an impact on nomadic communities, despite the country having completed the final phase of PMVC in November 2020. Outbreaks and case reports of suspected, probable and/or confirmed cases are also occurring in other settings in the region where nationwide phased PMVCs are ongoing and yet to be completed (DRC, Nigeria), or yet to be initiated (Chad, Niger), further compounding the risk of spread.Another potential factor contributing to the enhanced risk is a delay in the investigation of probable cases. The investigation of probable cases has faced challenges in many of the reporting countries made complicated due to stretched resources, capacity, and logistical challenges. The health systems in the nine countries with confirmed YF, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine rollout, have been strained with many other competing acute public health outbreaks which has diverted attention from YF preparedness and response activities.The numerous YF cases and outbreaks in a broad geographic scope, with upward trend of confirmed cases and outbreaks, is indication of ongoing intense YF virus transmission in an extended area in the region and represent a persistent and growing risk to all unvaccinated people living or visiting YF high-risk countries.Countries reporting probable but no confirmed YF case in 2021Probable YF cases have also been reported from Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali, Togo, and Uganda. The most recent, with samples collected during September/October, were two cases in Port-Gentil district (Ogoou\u00e9-Maritime province), Gabon and two cases in Haho (Notse city) and Ogou (Atakpame city) health districts, Plateaux region, Togo. These samples are currently being shipped to the regional reference laboratories for confirmation.Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes sp. and Haemogogus sp). Transmission can be amplified in circumstances where the Aedes mosquitos (day feeder) are present in urban settings and densely populated areas causing a rapid spread of the disease. While many people who become infected do not experience severe symptoms, a subset will develop severe disease. Following a 3-6-day incubation period, cases develop an \u201cacute\u201d phase illness characterized by fever, muscle pain with a prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea and/or vomiting, which resolves within 3-4 days. Approximately 15% of cases enter a second \u201ctoxic\u201d phase within 24 hours of initial remission, which may include high fever, jaundice with or without abdominal pain and vomiting, haemorrhage, and kidney failure, 50% of these cases die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.The risk at regional level is assessed as high due to;The overall risk at the global level is considered low, as no cases related to this current outbreak have been reported outside of the African region, at this stage. However, there are favourable ecosystems for YF outside the African region and there might be challenges in the surveillance and immunization capacities due to potential onward transmission, if not timely detected.More than 2 billion individuals in Asia live in areas where the competent vectors A. aegypti and A. albopictus are present. The expansion of global air travel and the rapid ecological and demographic changes increase the risk of YF introductions into Asia. Based on the interconnectivity with endemic countries, studies have suggested China, India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are at the greatest risk of YF introduction; however, the risk of autochthonous transmission is unknown. There is a risk of outbreaks in urban settings, introduced by viraemic travellers to largely unprotected urban populations such as Lagos (Nigeria), N\u2019Djamena (Chad) or Bangui (CAR), with continued risk of rapid amplification internationally.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, YF vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population are closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk to the Region and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.The countries reporting YF cases and outbreaks are all high priority countries for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. These countries have introduced yellow fever vaccination into their routine immunization schedule for those aged 9 months, and also requirements of proof of vaccination against YF for all incoming travellers \u22659 months, except Chad and Nigeria, who request proof of vaccination only for travellers coming from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreaks.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers 9 months of age or older going to yellow fever high risk countries. The affected countries also require a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged 9 months or over.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. When conditions permit, the EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive YF activities according to WHO guidance.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapidly medical advice when presenting signs. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 1 July 2020; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to the region on the basis of the information available on these outbreaks.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "West ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Central Africa", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/hepatitis-e-virus-republic-of-south-sudan", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-23", "headline": "Hepatitis E Virus \u2013 Republic of South Sudan", "main_text": "Cases of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) have been consistently reported in South Sudan since 2014, with recurrent outbreaks occurring in Bentiu, Rubkona county, Unity state (central-north part of South Sudan), where a camp for internally displaced persons (IDP) is located.In 2021, the number HEV cases have risen significantly in the country, increasing from 564 reported during the triennium 2018-2020, to 1143 suspected cases with five deaths in 2021 (as of 29 November). In last two years (2020-2021), a total of \u00a01420 suspected cases were reported, of which 47 have been laboratory confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).The current 2021 outbreak is occurring in Unity State, with cases mainly being reported from Bentiu IDP camp. This led the Ministry of Health (MoH) to declare a HEV outbreak in Bentiu internally displaced people \u00a0(IDP) camp in August 2021. A proportion of cases (323; 28.3%) has been reported from outside the camp, in Bentiu and Rubkona towns, suggesting ongoing transmission in the surrounding community. \u00a0Males aged 15-44 years are being reported as the most affected group, followed by male children 1-4 years, and females aged 15-44 years. There are no cases currently hospitalized, with clinical management implemented in outpatient departments (OPD).Bentiu IDP camp hosts over 107,000 people and is divided into five sectors. HEV cases are reported from all sectors, highlighting widespread transmission.Unity State, is also affected by a flood that has caused a massive displacement and the development of new IDP sites, adding 30,000 more IDPs hosted in the Bentiu IDP camp.Leadership and coordinationSurveillanceSupportive case managementWASHCommunity engagementHEV VaccinationHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus, transmitted by the faecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. It can lead to serious public health impacts particularly among special populations: those in IDP camps and pregnant women. Risk factors for HEV are linked to poor sanitation conditions, allowing viruses excreted in the stools of infected individuals to enter water intended for human consumption.Usually, the infection resolves spontaneously within 2 to 6 weeks, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.5-4%. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and progress to fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). Generally, CFR for pregnant women is reported to be higher than the overall CFR for HEV infections, reaching 25%. Displaced persons and refugees experience the highest attack rates when outbreaks occur given the overcrowded nature of their living conditions and poor hygiene situation.Cases of HEV have consistently been reported from Bentiu IDP camp since 2014 but have risen and surpassed epidemic threshold levels in 2021.The overall risk at the global level remains low, while at the national level is assessed as high due to:As the affected area is close to the border with Sudan and Ethiopia, at the regional level the overall risk is considered moderate due to the presence of the mobile IDP populations and refugees that cross these borders. While there have been fewer documented refugees coming from Ethiopia into South Sudan, a significant amount of traffic occurs for people heading to Sudan, particularly from Rubkona county - where the Bentiu IDP camp is located - to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.Additionally, there is a current outbreak of HEV at the border with South Darfur state in Sudan, that poses potential risk of cross-border spread.There is no specific treatment for HEV. Prevention is the most effective approach against this disease.To prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in neighbourhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat HEV epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.Since the incubation period for HEV ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.Interventions must continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries.To date, a hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization, and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risks, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals, such as pregnant women.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on South Sudan or any of the affected countries based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Hepatitis E Virus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Republic of South Sudan", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON351", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-16", "headline": "Ebola virus disease \u2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "On 16 December 2021, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared the end of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that affected Beni Health Zone (HZ) in North Kivu Province, DRC. The declaration was made in accordance with WHO recommendations , 42-days after the second negative test of the last confirmed case.Between 8 October to 16 December, a total of 11 cases (eight confirmed, three probable) including nine deaths and two survivors have been reported from Beni HZ. Of the nine deaths, seven were in the community and two occurred at the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). The overall case fatality ratio (CFR) is 82% (9/11) among total cases while 75% (6/8) among confirmed cases.This outbreak was declared on 8 October 2021 when the index case; a 3-year-old boy developed symptoms including physical weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, breathing difficulty, dark stool and blood in their vomit and later died on 6 October (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 10 October 2021).On 7 October, samples were tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) laboratory in Beni. These were later sent to the Rodolphe M\u00e9rieux INRB Laboratory, Goma on 8 October and EVD was confirmed by RT-PCR on the same day. This event followed a cluster of three deaths (two children and their father) who were neighbours of the index case. These three patients died on 14, 19 and 29 September after developing symptoms consistent with Ebola, however, none were tested for the virus. Full genome sequencing, performed by the INRB in Kinshasa city, from the initial confirmed case indicates that this outbreak was not the result of a new zoonosis from an animal reservoir but was linked to a persistent Ebola virus infection.During the outbreak period (8 October to 16 December 2021), three (16%) of the 19 health areas in Beni HZ reported confirmed cases, namely, Butsili (six cases), Bundji (one case) and Ngilinga (one case). Children under the age of five years accounted for 50% (4/8) of all confirmed cases. To date, all contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period and were discharged from active follow-up.Additionally, from 8 October to 13 December, a total of 21 916 alerts were reported from nine health zones including 15 642 from Beni, 21 558 (98%) of which were investigated and 1709 were validated as suspected cases of EVD.The Ministry of Health (MoH), together with WHO and other partners, initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent its further spread. The MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to the field to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on the outbreak prevention and control interventions.In addition, the following public health measures were taken in response to the EVD outbreak;The current re-emergence of EVD is the fifth outbreak in less than three years. The last EVD outbreak was reported in North Kivu Province earlier this year in February and was declared over on 3 May 2021 (for more details please see the Disease Outbreak News \u00a0published on 4 May 2021)All probable and confirmed EVD cases were identified in three health areas of Beni HZ, within the densely populated city of Beni.\u00a0 WHO continues to monitor the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information is available.WHO has noted that although the current resurgence is undesirable, it is not unexpected given the fact that EVD is enzootic in the DRC and the Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region; it means that the risk of re-emergence through exposure to an animal host cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major\u00a0outbreak. The Ebola virus can persist in certain body fluids of EVD survivors. In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to survivors' body fluids have occurred. Therefore, maintaining collaborative relationships with survivor associations while monitoring survivors is a priority to mitigate any potential risk.Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are gaps in the country\u2019s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors including poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of access and security, epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19, as well as ongoing outbreaks such as cholera and measles might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/cholera-cameroon", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-16", "headline": "Cholera \u2013 Cameroon", "main_text": "Since the beginning of 2021, Cameroon has reported sporadic cases of cholera. During week 43 of 2021, ending on 31 October, health authorities declared a cholera outbreak that is currently active in the South-West region, with cases also reported from the Centre and Littoral regions. Between 25 October and 10 December 2021, these three regions reported a cumulative number of 309 suspected and 4 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, with 19 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.1%).The South-West region, reported the first two cases on 27 October in Kesse area, Bamusso commune in Ekondo Titi health district. Two stool samples were collected from the cases and tested positive for cholera by culture at the Laquintinie Hospital laboratory in Douala. As of 10 December, a cumulative number of 163 suspected cases with 7 deaths (CFR 4.3%) have been identified in Ekondo Titi health district. Sixty-six percent of cases were male and 16.6% were under the age of five. The outbreak has spread to the neighbouring health district of Bakassi, with 95 suspected cases and 11 deaths (CFR 11.6%).On 28 October 2021, the Centre region, notified a suspected case of cholera with no epidemiological link to cases reported in the South-West region, from the health area of Akok-Ndoe, Biyem-Assi health district part of the urban community of Yaound\u00e9, the capital of Cameroon. A stool sample tested positive for cholera by Rapid Diagnostic Test, and on 29 October was confirmed positive by PCR and culture for Vibrio cholerae at the Pasteur Centre of Cameroon, Yaounde. A cumulative number of 50 suspected cases and one death (CFR 2%) have been reported from Biyem-Assi health district. Of these 52% were male and 8% were under the age of five. The last case to date in the Centre region was reported on 11 November 2021.In the Littoral region, a cholera case was confirmed by culture on 21 November 2021 in an eight-year-old boy at the Laquintinie Hospital laboratory in Douala. This has remained an isolated case with no further suspected cases. His family and those in his neighbourhood also reported no history of travel.CoordinationSurveillanceLaboratory and Case managementWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)Risk Communication and Community EngagementCholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria present in contaminated water or food. In its severe form, it can lead to severe dehydration and death within hours if left untreated. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.Cholera is endemic in Cameroon. Since 2018, cholera outbreaks have been reported annually in various regions of the country including in the currently affected regions (South-West, Centre and Littoral). Several risk factors concur with the circulation of Vibrio cholera in the country, including limited access to safe drinking water and health care facilities in the affected areas of the South-West region and in the capital city of Yaound\u00e9, as well as cultural practices that contribute to unsafe WASH conditions.The Biyem-Assi health district in the Centre region is a densely populated area with insufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation, that is located in the heart of the capital city Yaound\u00e8. This may allow a cholera outbreak to spread quickly if swift control measures are not implemented.The affected health districts in the South-West region (Ekondo Titi, Bakassi and Mobonge) belong to an archipelago in a humanitarian crisis zone with an ongoing armed conflict, and the risk of cholera exportation to other neighbouring districts cannot be excluded. Security constraints, limited geographic accessibility of some areas, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. The populations have no or limited access to safe drinking water and latrines, and the overall hygienic conditions are inadequate. There is limited access to health care and patients may have to travel long distances by boat to seek care.In addition, the affected South-West region borders Nigeria, and there is a frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. In the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno and Taraba states of Nigeria which are currently affected by a cholera outbreak. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon. Therefore, the risk at the national and regional levels is assessed as high. At the global level, the risk is considered low.WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, proper waste management, food safety practices and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Key public health communication messages should be provided.Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improving access to care, should be implemented in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to decrease the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in border areas with active population movements, WHO encourages respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to and from Cameroon based on the information available on the current outbreak.WHO fact sheet on choleraWHO Health Topics \u2013 CholeraGlobal Task Force on Cholera Control", "reports": {"diseases": ["Cholera"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Cameroon", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/dengue-fever-pakistan", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-14", "headline": "Dengue fever \u2013 Pakistan", "main_text": "Dengue is endemic in Pakistan, with the last notable outbreak, with 53,498 cases and 95 deaths, being reported between September to December 2019.From\u00a01\u00a0January to\u00a025\u00a0November\u00a02021, a total of 48,906 cases including 183 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 0.4%) have been reported from four provinces including Punjab,\u00a0Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh,\u00a0Balochistan, and the federally administered Islamabad Capital\u00a0Territory\u00a0(ICT),\u00a0and\u00a0Azad\u00a0Jammu and\u00a0Kashmir autonomous\u00a0territories\u00a0(AJK), Pakistan.As of\u00a025\u00a0November, Punjab\u00a0province\u00a0reported\u00a0the highest number of cases\u00a0with\u00a024,146\u00a0cases\u00a0and 127 deaths (CFR: 0.5%) accounting\u00a0for 49.4% and 69.4% of all cases and deaths, respectively.

Secondary infections put people at greater risk of severe dengue leading to hospital admissions.\u00a0\u00a0In Pakistan, dengue fever is endemic with reports of seasonal surges of cases and circulation of the different serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) in various parts of the country. Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0A.\u00a0albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications if not treated promptly and correctly.With the current COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0affecting\u00a0the national health system capacity, and competing communicable disease outbreaks, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better case detection,\u00a0sensitized\u00a0health care providers on case management\u00a0and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness in Pakistan to better define disease burden and seasonality patterns.The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare reduces severe dengue and mortality.\u00a0Furthermore, the prevention and control of dengue depends\u00a0on effective sustained vector control measures.WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp.\u00a0(the vector of dengue) .\u00a0IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure.\u00a0This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e.,\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households.\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals).Vector control activities may include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis.Where indoor biting occurs,\u00a0application of mosquito repellent lotion or sprays on skin, use of\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers\u00a0are recommended. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes are day biters (the primary vector for transmission) with peak\u00a0activity at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures including the\u00a0use of clothing\u00a0to minimize\u00a0skin exposure\u00a0are\u00a0recommended.\u00a0During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people who sleep outside or during the day (e.g.,\u00a0infants, bedridden and night\u00a0workers) including dengue patients in hospitals and at night to prevent mosquito bites.In addition, vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country.\u00a0Key public health messages on reducing the risk of dengue transmission among the population are expected to continue to be provided.\u00a0 Community based health workers should be sensitized on these key messages to be promoted in all affected areas.WHO does not recommend any general or trade restrictions\u00a0to\u00a0Pakistan based on the information available for this\u00a0event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Pakistan", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)-united-arab-emirates", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-13", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 United Arab Emirates", "main_text": "On 17 November 2021, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in UAE.The case is a\u00a060-year-old male from the Abu Dhabi region, UAE. He developed fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and a runny nose on 3 November and presented to hospital on 5 November. On 6 November, he was admitted to hospital where a computerized tomography\u00a0(CT) scan confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. On 11 November, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2\u00a0testing was also performed, and the results were negative. \u00a0The patient has diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia as co-morbidities. He owns a dromedary camel farm in Abu Dhabi and had a history of close contact with dromedary camels at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. No travel history was reported during the same period. The patient has recovered and was discharged following two negative tests for MERS-CoV.Since July 2013, a total of 93 cases including the current case of MERS-CoV have been reported from UAE.Upon identification, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is currently ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts at the patient\u2019s household, his camel farm and healthcare facilities. Fifty-one contacts were identified and were monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed case.All samples from close contacts of the patients tested negative for MERS-CoV. One health care worker who identified as a close contact is currently outside of UAE and has been notified and advised to self-monitor. He is asymptomatic.The veterinary authorities have been notified and an investigation of animals is ongoing.Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans but it has, so far, mainly occurred in health care settings and to a limited extent among close contacts.The notification of this additional case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information. However, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacities for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in some countries since most of the resources are redirected to prevent and control the pandemic.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. Therefore, IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. \u00a0Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, supported quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions with UAE.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-(cvdpv2)-yemen", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-09", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) \u2013 Yemen", "main_text": "On 22 November 2021, the International Health Regulations national focal point (IHR NFP) for Yemen notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in stool samples from two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Yemen.The first case, a nine-year-old girl, from Thubab district, Taiz governorate, south-western Yemen, experienced onset of paralysis on 30 August. The child had not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool samples were collected on 31 August and 2 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November, with 10 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.The second case, a 26-month-old girl, from Marib district, Marib governorate, north-east of Sana\u2019a city, experienced onset of paralysis on 1 September. The child had also not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool specimens were collected on 4 and 5 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November with 11 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.The two districts do not share a border and are approximately 430 km apart.\u00a0The two VDPV isolates are genetically linked, and therefore, classified as cVDPV2. This is a new emergence and the viruses detected are not related to other known cVDPV2s globally.The confirmation of cVDPV2 comes in the context of an ongoing outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), which has to date paralyzed 35 children (three in 2021, 31 in 2020, and one in 2019).The last VDPV2 case in the country was reported in June 2016 in Aden governorate, southern Yemen, and was classified as ambiguous[1] VDPV2 (aVDPV2). According to the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage, polio vaccine third dose (POL3) coverage was reported to be 66% in 2020.The Ministry of Health, supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, conducted a field investigation, and started implementing the polio outbreak preparedness and response plan. In addition, AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced.The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to\u00a0 significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. \u00a0Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.The Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) convened a meeting in November 2021 on the international spread of poliovirus in multiple countries. As per the report released, the Emergency Committee expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2 to many countries and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently high.The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to\u00a0 significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. \u00a0Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s\u00a0International Travel and Health\u00a0recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of the\u00a0Emergency Committee, the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk is strongly encouraged. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations.\u00a0To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict travel of individuals at the point of departure if not vaccinated or cannot prove their vaccination status.[1]\u00a0Ambiguous VDPV (aVDPV): a VDPV isolate from individuals or from environmental samples, without evidence of circulation and from individuals with no known immunodeficiency.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Yemen", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---ghana", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-01", "headline": "Yellow Fever - Ghana", "main_text": "From 15 October to 27 November 2021, 202 suspected cases of Yellow Fever (YF) including 70 confirmed cases and 35 deaths [Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): 17%] have been reported in four regions in Ghana (Savannah, Upper West, Bono and Oti regions). YF is endemic in Ghana and is associated with severe disease in approximately 15% of cases and a high CFR. YF cases were reported mostly from nomadic populations who had moved from Nigeria into a forest reserve in Ghana\u2019s Savannah region which is visited by tourists. The region shares porous borders with Cote d\u2019lvoire and Burkina Faso, highlighting the potential for spread outside of Ghana. The cases, age ranging from 4 months to 70 years, presented with symptoms of body pain, fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, jaundice and bleeding from the gums. Females accounted for 52% (105/202) of the cases. A YF outbreak was confirmed after three samples tested positive for YF by PCR (negative for Ebola virus disease, dengue and other viral hemorrhagic fevers) at Institute Pasteur Dakar in Senegal, the regional reference laboratory. As of 27 November, 70 out of 196 samples collected have tested positive for YF by IgM and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and results are pending for 68 samples. Plaque reduction neutralization testing was positive in 5 samples at the regional reference laboratory.Although there is high overall population immunity against YF in Ghana (88% in 2020 according to WHO-UNICEF estimates), pockets of the population, including unvaccinated nomadic people, remain at risk for YF which could result in continued YF transmission. The current outbreak investigation found settlements of newcomer populations who had arrived after the last mass campaign and were largely unvaccinated.Surveillance and laboratoryVaccinationVector ControlRisk communicationThe overall risk of YF from this event at the national, regional and global levels are assessed as moderate, moderate and low, respectively. YF is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes spp. and Haemogogus spp.). A subset of people who become infected with YF experience severe symptoms. Approximately 15% of the cases enter the second toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. The second toxic phase may be characterized by fever, jaundice, with or without abdominal pain, vomiting haemorrhage and kidney failure. Of these, 20-50% die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination offers lifelong immunity and is considered to be the most important means of preventing YF, while other strategies such as vector control are complementary. There is no specific treatment for YF, and cases receive supportive care for complications such as dehydration, renal failure and fever.The national risk was assessed as moderate due to the following reasons:The regional risk was assessed as moderate due to the favorable ecosystem in the neighboring countries and porous borders. The global risk was assessed as low, however, the Mole National Park which is located in both North and West Gonja Districts is visited by tourists, therefore there could be a risk of exportation of the virus.Ghana is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of YF. In 1992, the Government of Ghana introduced YF vaccine into the routine immunization programme for children at 9 months as part of the national YF control and elimination programme. In urban centers, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers to Ghana, aged 9 months or older. YF vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against YF extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of YF vaccine cannot be required for international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of YF signs and symptoms, and instructed to promptly seek medical advice when presenting signs. Returning travellers who are viraemic may pose a risk for establishing local transmission cycles of YF where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Ghana in relation to this event, based on available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Ghana", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON344", "date_of_publication": "2021-11-25", "headline": "Monkeypox - United States of America", "main_text": "On 16 November 2021, the IHR National Focal Point of the United States of America (USA) notified PAHO/WHO of an imported case of human monkeypox in Maryland, USA.

The frequency of global travel indicates that further exported cases may be expected among travelers from endemic areas / countries. Additionally, there may be cases that are undetected, misdiagnosed, or not reported.The USA CDC is working with their international health counterparts, state, and local health officials to assess potential risks and to contact airline passengers and others who may have had contact with the patient on flights from Nigeria to Turkey and onwards to the USA, in transit, or after arrival in the USA. Travelers on these flights were required to wear masks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on these flights is therefore considered low.Public health measures are being taken, including isolation and continued monitoring of the patient\u2019s clinical recovery. Possible contacts are being notified for assessment and monitoring by their local or state health department. Post-exposure vaccination with a smallpox vaccine within 14 days of the last contact with the case may be recommended for cases who are at intermediate and high risk.Healthcare providers have been advised to be vigilant to poxvirus-like lesions, particularly among travelers returning from Nigeria. Because of the public health risks associated with a single case of monkeypox, clinicians should report suspected cases immediately to state or local public health authorities regardless of whether they are also exploring other potential diagnoses.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that belongs to the\u00a0Orthopoxvirus\u00a0family. Genomic sequencing shows there are two monkeypox clades \u2013 Congo Basin and West African\u00a0and there have been observed differences in human pathogenicity and mortality in the two geographic areas. Both clades can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets or contact with fomites such as bedding; infection can be fatal in humans.The incubation period for monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days. The disease is often self-limiting with signs and symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within two to four weeks. Signs and symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be painful. Immune deficiency, young age, and pregnancy appear to be risk factors for severe disease. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the West African clade has been reported to be around 1%. The recent outbreak in Nigeria recorded a higher CFR related to underlying conditions which may lead to immunodeficiency. A case fatality ratio of up to 11% (in individuals without prior smallpox vaccination) has been reported for the Congo basin clade.Since 2017, a monkeypox outbreak has been occurring in Nigeria with 218 cases confirmed to date. In addition to Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in nine other countries in central and western Africa since 1970. These include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Sudan. Sporadic small outbreaks continue to occur in some of these countries including Cameroon and the Central African Republic. However, the vast majority of cases continue to be reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 2780 cases and 72 deaths (CFR 2.6%) reported between 1 January through 31 October 2021.While a new vaccine has been approved for the prevention of monkeypox, and traditional smallpox vaccine has been demonstrated to provide protection, these vaccines are not widely available. Increased susceptibility of humans to monkeypox is thought to be related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or use of animal-derived products are presumed sources of human infection. Milder cases of monkeypox in adults could go undetected, misdiagnosed, or unreported and represent a risk of human-to-human transmission.There is likely to be little immunity to infection in those exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to West and Central Africa and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox disease, and care is symptom-based optimal care. In some circumstances, treatment approved for smallpox may be offered on a compassionate or emergency use basis.Any illness during travel in an endemic area or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travelers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick, dead, or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (mammals including rodents, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game or use of products derived from animals. The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.A patient with monkeypox should be isolated during the infectious period, just prior to and including the rash stage of the infection and until all lesions have crusted and fallen off. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of endemic and imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential parts of preventing secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks.Treatment for monkeypox is optimal care based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and clinical condition.Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to or trade with Nigeria, Turkey or the USA based on available information at this point in time.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United States of America", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-(cvdpv2)-ukraine", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-22", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) \u2013 Ukraine", "main_text": "On 2 October 2021, WHO was notified of the isolation of poliovirus in the samples from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case in Ukraine. The individual is a 17-month old female who had onset of paralysis on 3 September. Poliovirus type 2 was confirmed on 1 October by the Regional Reference Lab (RRL) in Helsinki, Finland, and further genetic sequencing at RRL confirmed vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) on 6 October. The same virus has also been isolated from six healthy siblings of the case. The family is from Rivne province, in the northwest of Ukraine.Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is closely linked with an environmental isolate in Tajikistan. Local authorities, along with\u00a0WHO regional and country teams, are conducting further investigations to determine the\u00a0source\u00a0of the infection, and to\u00a0ascertain any potential risk of further spread.\u00a0Therefore, the current outbreak was classified as circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2).Previously, an outbreak of circulating VDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) was reported in Ukraine in 2015, resulting in two cases. The last reported VDPV was classified as VDPV2 in Ukraine\u2019s Odesa province in 2016. The virus isolated from the current reported case in Rivne is not related to the 2015 outbreak or 2016 isolates.The national immunization coverage with three doses of polio vaccine (POL3) in Ukraine was 83% in 2020.The Ministry of Health led multi-disciplinary emergency task force has been established to coordinate the public health response. Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), including WHO, are providing support to authorities at national and subnational levels. This support includes outbreak investigation, intensified surveillance, and raising public awareness.Supplemental vaccination of all young children in the affected area is planned to ensure catch-up for any eligible children who may have missed routine polio vaccination and ensure that all are protected from the disease.The risk of national spread is assessed as high due to historically low immunization coverage rates in Ukraine and the existing subnational vaccination gaps. Although AFP surveillance is sensitive enough to detect paralytic cases, poliovirus transmission may continue undetected.The risk of international spread of this virus is currently assessed as low due to the relatively high immunization coverage and sanitary infrastructure in neighboring countries, particularly Belarus, Hungary, and Slovakia. However, the European Regional Commission for Certification of Polio Eradication expressed concern about the quality of polio surveillance and suboptimal vaccination coverage in Poland and Romania.It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates at subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel.Countries affected by poliovirus circulation are subject to temporary recommendations issued by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations on Polioviruses, due to the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

This represents the first Zika virus disease case ever reported from Kerala. ZIKV viral RNA was detected through RT-PCR testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, in a blood sample collected from the patient, a 24-year-old pregnant woman in her third trimester of pregnancy resident in Trivandrum district. On 28 June 2021, she was admitted to a private hospital with arbovirus like symptoms of fever, headache and general rash. Laboratory results were negative for dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The woman delivered on 7 July, she was reportedly in good health and there were no apparent birth defects in the new-born. In the 3 months before delivery, she had resided in Trivandrum district not having traveled during that period. Among her close contacts, her mother reported having fever and similar symptoms one week before ZIKV confirmation in her daughter.Retrospective testing was conducted among 19 hospital staff and patients at the same private hospital who had previously presented with fever, myalgia, arthralgia and petechial lesions in May 2021. Blood samples collected from these 19 ZIKV suspected cases were sent to NIV Pune, and on 10 July the laboratory results confirmed that 13 of the 19 samples tested positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR, indicating cryptic transmission of ZIKV in Kerala state since May 2021.During the period from 8 to 26 July 2021, 590 blood samples were collected in Kerala state through active case finding and passive surveillance. Of them, 70 (11.9%) tested positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR at NIV Pune, including four additional pregnant women. All these cases were from Trivandrum district, except two cases reported from Ernakulam and Kottayam districts, who both had recent travel history to Trivandrum district.On 31 July 2021, Maharashtra state also reported its first Zika laboratory-confirmed case from Belsar, a village of 3500 inhabitants located in Purandar Taluka administrative unit, Pune district. The case, a 50-year-old women, tested positive for both ZIKV (by RT-PCR and sero-neutralization) and CHIKV (by RT- PCR and IgM ELISA) at NIV Pune. Fifty-one additional samples from ZIKV suspected cases were collected from Belsar village, of them 40 tested negative for ZIKV and 11 are still pending for results.So far, no cases of microcephaly and/or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been linked with this outbreak.The Kerala Health department, along with local self-government health departments has implemented the following response activities:ZIKV can cause large epidemics with a substantial demand on the public health system including surveillance, case management, and laboratory capacity to differentiate ZIKV disease from illness due to co-circulating mosquito-borne viruses like dengue and chikungunya. Although 60-80% of the Zika virus infected cases are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, ZIKV can cause microcephaly, congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and GBS. Moreover, although ZIKV is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, it can also be transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and organ transplantation.In India, ZIKV disease cases/infections have been detected in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan states in 2018 (South-East Asian lineage), but no ZIKV-associated microcephaly has been reported. Although this event is not unexpected, given the wide distribution of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and competent vector, Aedes albopictus, in Kerala and Maharashtra states, this is unusual as it is the first time that ZIKV disease cases have been confirmed in these states.The overall risk is considered low at the regional level and global level, while at the national level (Kerala and Maharashtra States) is currently assessed as moderate, given that:Protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent ZIKV infection. Special attention should be given to the prevention of mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children.Aedes mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and workplaces. It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites by appropriate methods, including: covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flower pots, and cleaning up trash and used tires. Community initiatives are essential to support local government and public health programmes to reduce mosquito breeding sites. Health authorities may also advise the use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread. Semi-urban areas should prevent the breeding of Aedes spp., in rubber plantations and other stagnant pools of water.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high-risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include the use of repellents, wearing light coloured, long-sleeved shirts and pants, ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.For regions with active transmission of ZIKV, all persons with suspected ZIKV infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of ZIKV.WHO recommends that sexually active men and women be correctly counselled about ZIKV infection and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant in order to prevent congenital Zika syndrome and other possible adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes.Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant due to concerns about ZIKV infection should have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling. Pregnant women should practice safer sex (including correct and consistent use of condoms) or abstain from sexual activity for the entire duration of pregnancy. Pregnant women should be encouraged to attend scheduled appointments and enhanced antenatal care and follow-up, including ultrasound imaging to detect microcephaly and other developmental anomalies associated with ZIKV infection in pregnancy, in accordance with the state/national response plan.For regions with no active transmission of ZIKV, WHO recommends practicing safer sex or abstinence for a period of six months for men and two months for women who are returning from areas of active ZIKV transmission to prevent infection of their sex partners. Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of ZIKV occurs, should practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity throughout pregnancy.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Zika Virus Disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "India", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-13", "headline": "Yellow Fever- Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)", "main_text": "On 1 October 2021, the IHR National Focal Point (NFP) for Venezuela reported seven confirmed human cases of yellow fever which were investigated between 23 and 24 September 2021. All seven caes were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Rafael Rangel National Hygiene Institute. Six of the seven reported cases were not vaccinated. Of these, three were asymptomatic and four developed signs and symptoms between 20 to 24 September, all presented fever and one of the cases also presented with a headache, retro ocular pain, arthralgias and a skin rash. The probable location of infection was a rural parish locality, south of the Matur\u00edn Municipality in the Monagas State, which is in the northeast region of Venezuela. The first reported case was a young pregnant woman with a history of yellow fever vaccination. Of the remaining six cases, five were male and ranged between 24 and 82 years of age.To date, no deaths have been reported among the confirmed cases.Additionally, between 11 August and 1 October 2021, 10 epizootics among non-human primates (NHP) were reported in Venezuela as part of the routine national surveillance. Seven epizootics were located in Monagas state (in the municipalities of Maturin and Aguasay (70 km from Maturin municipality) and three in Anzo\u00e1tegui state (Freites Municipality, 159 km from Maturin municipality). Two of the epizootics were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory (LNR) both reported in Monagas State and eight (five from Monagas and three from Anzo\u00e1tegui) were confirmed by an epidemiological link (given the time-space relationship with laboratory confirmed epizootics). Confirmed epizootics were identified at 35 km and 150 km from the urban area of Matur\u00edn within the state of Monagas.National and local health authorities in Venezuela\u00a0are implementing public health measures, including the following:Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV) and is transmitted by infected mosquitoes of the genera\u00a0Haemagogus\u00a0and\u00a0Sabethes, as well as the urban mosquito species\u00a0Aedes aegypti.\u00a0 Yellow fever infects humans and non-human primates (NHP) and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection as the disease is preventable with a single dose of yellow fever vaccine which provides immunity for life. While there is no specific treatment, supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections can reduce mortality and is recommended. Viraemic cases should stay under mosquito nets during the day to limit the risk of spread to others through bites of mosquitoes, and vector control strategies may complement particularly during outbreaks.Venezuela is considered high risk for yellow fever with endemic virus transmission and is a priority country for the global Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. Vaccination coverage is suboptimal, creating a high risk for onward transmission and amplification of yellow fever among unvaccinated populations.The increased number of human cases and epizootics since August 2021, is concerning due to the persistence of high viral circulation. Since November 2020, when the vaccination campaign began in prioritized states, 82% immunization coverage has been achieved, with five out of the 10 states with 100% coverage (Amazonas, Apure, Delta Amacuro, Sucre and T\u00e1chira). The remaining five states vary in vaccine coverage (Anzo\u00e1tegui 97.2%, Gu\u00e1rico 95.5%, Bol\u00edvar 78.9%, Monagas 67.7%, and Zulia 44.7%). The state where the outbreak has occurred, Monagas state, has low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant population remains at-risk with a necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.Despite the significant efforts made to vaccinate a large portion of the population, the increasing number of human cases and the persistence and geographical spread of epizootics among NHP illustrate the potential risk of further spread to areas where YF immunization coverage is low. Special attention should also be placed on specific at-risk groups and ethnic minorities. There is a long-standing pattern of movements of indigenous people across borders among settlements of the same culture, including to neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago. According to the International Organization for Migration[i], the flow of Warao people moving from their villages in Venezuela to Brazil, to Guyana and possibly to Suriname has increased dramatically since 2017 and persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Monagas State and national level governments along with the PAHO/WHO field team carried out activities to intensify surveillance among NHPs and entomological populations, as well as vector control in urban areas. However, epizootic and entomological surveillance needs to be strengthened in the affected and surrounding areas where human cases were detected.The yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela is occurring in the context of a major and complex situation, which includes the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic creates a risk of disruption access to health care due to COVID-19 related burdens on the health system, lack of health workers along with decreased vaccination demand due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.The capacity of local laboratories and national reference laboratories may also be compromised due to the increased demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 13 October, Venezuela reported 384 668 COVID 19 cases and 4634 deaths, and currently is among the eight countries with the highest number of COVID-19 new cases in the last 24 hours in the Region of the Americas.All yellow fever endemic and high risk regions and territories are also experiencing ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the addition of YFV as a co-circulating virus could pose an additional challenge for case management and infection and prevention control activities if there was a large scale yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela or neighbouring countries.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.The reported YF cases illustrate the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in endemic high-risk areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission.Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. Vaccination coverage should be increased particularly in people living and working in forested areas, who are exposed during the day to sylvatic vectors (Haemagogus spp\u00a0and\u00a0Sabethes spp\u00ad). Vaccination coverage should also be increased among indigenous populations, migrants and other vulnerable populations who often live in densely populated urban areas (with a risk of urban local transmission via Aedes agyepti) or participate in activities in forested areas (with a risk of sporadic cases or clusters in a sylvatic context).WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers over 9 months old at least 10 days prior to travel to Venezuela (see map here). Venezuela does not request a vaccination certificate for incoming travellers.Yellow fever vaccination recommended by WHO is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. The EYE strategy promotes maintaining and improving vaccination against YF of all eligible children in routine services and supports campaigns for large-scale populations where required according to WHO guidelines for implementation in COVID-19.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice when presenting with any of them. Infected (viraemic) returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Venezuela on the basis of the information available on this event.Framework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19XXVI Meeting of PAHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.

The case, a child under 5 years old, from Central constituency, Lilongwe district, Central Region, developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 19 November 2021. Two stool specimens were collected for testing on 26 and 27 November, and were received at the Regional Reference Laboratory, the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) in South Africa, on 14 January 2022, and then forwarded to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC).Sequencing of the virus conducted by the NICD on 2 February, and the US CDC on 12 February confirmed this case as WPV1. Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020 after eliminating all forms of wild polio from the region, and in Malawi, the last clinically confirmed WPV case was reported in 1992.On 17 February 2022, WHO received an update regarding the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Malawi which was previously notified on 31 January 2022 through an IHR notification as a case of poliovirus type 2 (PV2). The case, a child under 5 years old, from Central constituency, Lilongwe district, Central Region, developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 19 November 2021.

Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.Polio is a highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis (approximately one in 200 infections) or death (approximately 2-10% of paralyzed cases). The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food).Two of the three types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1. Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The detection of WPV1 outside the two countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of WPV1.The risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (<80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than six years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 April 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 December 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.Additionally, the country is currently affected by tropical storm Ana which may impact the country\u2019s response capacity by impairing Polio SIAs and surveillance activities. According to the UN flash update on Malawi tropical storm Ana, as of 11 February, there have been 995 072 people affected in 19 districts, 206 people injured, 46 people reported dead, and 18 people are reported still missing. The United Nations and partners are supporting the life-saving emergency flood responseThe risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the significant population movement between Mozambique and Malawi, suboptimal vaccination coverage in the neighbouring countries, and suboptimal AFP surveillance activities.The risk at the global level is assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place and the moderately high global Polio coverage estimates.It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response.Under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), countries must investigate and notify any poliovirus isolate, whether the isolate is from AFP cases, AFP contacts or environmental surveillance. Local health authorities should initiate the investigation within 24 hours of a poliovirus isolate being reported.Isolation of poliovirus in a previously non-infected area represents an event or outbreak that requires national authorities to complete an immediate risk assessment to inform the type and scale of response. Following initial investigation and risk assessment, national authorities must continue to collect detailed information to update the situation analysis and risk assessment (i.e. results from laboratory investigations, or detailed information on affected communities, etc.). Neighbouring countries/regions must also continue to update their risk assessment with support from WHO regional offices.Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates (>90%) both at national and subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction. WHO recommends that two high-quality large-scale vaccination campaigns (>90% of children vaccinated) should be completed within eight weeks of laboratory sequencing results. A mop-up round might be required as an additional step wherever monitoring suggests children have been missed in certain health districts or areas, to ensure interruption of transmission (even in the absence of new poliovirus detections). Communication and social mobilization activities should be an integrated part of reactive Polio immunization campaigns.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to Malawi based on the information available for this current event. WHO\u2019s\u00a0International Travel and Health\u00a0recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of an\u00a0Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\u00a0 Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, consider vaccination of all international travelers, ensure such travelers are provided with an international certificate of vaccination, restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination, intensify cross-border efforts to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers, and intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage.Citable reference: World Health Organization (03 March 2022).

After returning to the United Kingdom, the individual developed symptoms of fever, fatigue and loose stool, and was subsequently hospitalized. The first case has now recovered. The second and third cases were family members of the first case and did not travel to Mali. Both were admitted to the hospital and the third case has sadly died.On 8 February, samples from both the first and second cases were laboratory confirmed positive for Lassa virus by PCR. The third case was initially provided care as a probable case of Lassa fever and the diagnosis was confirmed on 9 February.Incident responses have been activated by health authorities in the United Kingdom to coordinate the clinical and public health management of these cases.People with exposure to the cases were identified through robust contact tracing activities. Low and high risk contacts are being followed up for 21 days after their last exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis has been offered to high-risk contacts with the most significant exposures. Systems are in place to assess and manage any contacts who may develop symptoms during the follow up period.Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with infected Mastomys rats\u2019 urine or faeces. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions, particularly in health care settings. It can cause severe disease in about 20% of patients. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is 1% overall and 15% in severely ill patients. Early recognition and initiation of patient care decrease the CFR and public health impact.Lassa fever is endemic in Mali and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from countries in West Africa where the disease is endemic, such as Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia and Nigeria in recent years. However, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is known to be extremely rare when appropriate infection prevention and control precautions and laboratory biosafety measures are applied. The only secondary transmission of Lassa fever reported in Europe was in 2016 from Germany, when the secondary case performed post-mortem care of a fatal case.Human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles, as well as direct contact with bodily secretions. Health care workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, although information from recent imported cases in Europe show that secondary transmission of Lassa virus is rare when standard IPC precautions are followed. The possibility of additional secondary cases related to transmission in a health care setting cannot currently be excluded, but is considered very unlikely in the community.Prevention of Lassa fever in endemic countries relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. Family members and health care workers should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick individuals.In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard IPC measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, or handling their clinical specimens, should reinforce standard and contact precautions, comprising appropriate hand hygiene, rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, isolation, safe injections practices and safe burial practices. In order to avoid any direct contact with blood and body fluids and/or splashes onto facial mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) when providing direct care for a patient with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, personal protective equipment should include: 1) clean non-sterile gloves; 2) clean, non-sterile fluid resistant gown; and 3) protection of facial mucosa against splashes (mask and eye protection, or a face shield).Given the nonspecific presentation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, isolation of ill travellers and consistent implementation of standard and contact precautions is key to preventing secondary transmission. When consistently applied, these measures can prevent secondary transmission even if travel history information is not obtained, not immediately available, or the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever is delayed.There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.Considering the seasonal increases of cases between December and March, countries in West Africa that have endemic Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems to enhance early detection and treatment of cases, and to reduce the case fatality rate, as well as to strengthen cross border collaboration.Citable reference:\u00a0World Health Organization (21 February 2022).

Three states account for 82% of confirmed cases: Ondo (63), Edo (57) and Bauchi (53). The other states affected are Benue (11), Ebonyi (5), Oyo (5), Taraba (5), Kogi (4), Enugu (2), Kaduna (2), Cross River (1), Delta (1), Katsina (1) and Plateau (1) (Figure 2).Of the 211 laboratory confirmed cases, five cases have been reported among health workers in two states, Edo (3) and Benue (2).Figure 1.\u00a0Weekly number of reported confirmed Lassa Fever cases and deaths in Nigeria during the epidemiological weeks one (commencing 2 January) through four (commencing 23 January) in 2022.In contrast, noticeably less Lassa fever cases with less geographical spread were reported for the same period (epidemiological weeks 1- 4) in 2021 (54 confirmed cases, including 12 deaths, from 8 States).Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the annual peak of Lassa fever cases is typically observed during the dry season (December\u2013April). Thus, the number of infections is expected to rise further until the end of the dry season.While endemic in Nigeria, cases are much higher than the previous epidemic seasons. This could be attributed to reduced response capacity in surveillance and laboratory testing. It is necessary to continue to monitor the annual peaks of Lassa fever in order to contextualize incidence and inform the effective management of Lassa fever.Figure 2.\u00a0Confirmed cases of Lassa fever by States reported in Nigeria from 3 \u2013 30 January 2022Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces from Mastomys rats. Though to a lesser extent, secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health-care settings.As aforementioned, the peak of Lassa fever cases in humans typically occurs in the dry season (December-April) and follows the reproduction cycle of the Mastomys rats in the wet season (May \u2013 November). Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats\u2019 excreta) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in the rat population poses a risk for further human infection during the dry season.Approximately 80% of Lassa virus infections in humans are either asymptomatic or mild, however, infection in the remaining 20% manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio among all infected people is approximately 1% but is significantly higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness (around 15%).Timely diagnosis results in more rapid isolation of patients and provision of treatment, while also reducing the risk of person-to-person transmission in health care settings. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival of patients.The current overall risk is considered high at national level. While Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the country has developed an increased capacity for the prevention and control of Lassa fever outbreaks, including strengthened surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity, several factors contribute to the current elevated risk level. These include an increase in the number of confirmed cases compared to previous epidemic seasons, gaps in surveillance and varying degrees of subnational response capacity, delays in sample shipment for laboratory testing, a decrease of case management capacity due to conversion of dedicated Lassa fever facilities into COVID-19 health-care facilities and suboptimal IPC procedures. These factors combined warrant the need for further improvement and support of the country\u2019s capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks. In addition, the five confirmed cases among health workers, which included two workers caring for the same patient in the emergency ward, further emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures.The overall regional and global risk is considered low due to minimal cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighbouring countries. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in West African countries, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, but may exist in other countries in the same region.Mastomys\u00a0rats are the main reservoir for Lassa virus and so abundant in endemic areas in West Africa that it is not possible to eliminate them from the environment. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of waste far from the home, maintaining clean households and considering keeping cats. Precaution should be taken when handling Mastomys rats. \u00a0All animal products should be thoroughly cooked.Those caring for affected persons should be careful and avoid contact with blood and body fluids.In health-care settings, health workers and volunteers should apply standard infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for individuals, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials) and safe injection practices.Health workers caring for those with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the person\u2019s blood, body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 meter) of individuals with Lassa fever, health workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Personnel working in laboratories are also at risk. Samples taken from suspected Lassa fever cases for diagnostics should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.WHO continues to advise all countries endemic for Lassa fever on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria and the affected areas based on the currently available information.Citable reference:\u00a0World Health Organization (14 February 2022).

Following periods of lower transmission in 2019 and 2020, and amid the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, weekly notifications of suspected measles cases have been increasing in all provinces since the end of July 2021, with the highest weekly toll observed in the last four weeks in January 2022 (Figure 1). The number of cases and deaths increased by 18% and 40% respectively from week 4, 2022 (week commencing January 24) to week 5, 2022 (week commencing January 31).Figure 1. Weekly number of reported suspected measles cases in Afghanistan. Week 1, 2018 to week 4, 2022. Source: WHO Country Office in Afghanistan, WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.From 1 January 2021 to 29 January 2022, 35 319 suspected measles cases were reported in Afghanistan, of which 3221 (9%) were laboratory-confirmed by IgM-ELISA in the seven reference laboratories (one national and six regional). Most of the suspected measles cases (91%) occurred among children less than 5 years of age. During the same period, 156 measles deaths were reported among the confirmed cases (CFR=4.8%), with more than 97% of the fatalities registered among children less than 5 years of age. Although the number of deaths is relatively low, the rapid rise in cases suggests that the trend of reported deaths will continue to increase sharply in the coming weeks.The most affected provinces, with the highest number of reported cases (confirmed and suspected) are Balkh, Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kabul, Paktika, and Paktya. Figure 2 shows the measles notification rate (confirmed and suspected cases) per million population. The highest rates were observed in Paktya (617 cases per 1 000 000), Balkh (275 cases per 1 000 000), Kunduz (204 cases per 1 000 000) Zabul (168 cases per 1 000 000), Kandahar (145 cases per 1 000 000), Logar (127 cases per 1 000 000).Figure 2.

Unvaccinated young children are at the highest risk of measles and its complications (e.g. pneumonia and encephalitis), including death. Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics with a high case fatality rate, especially among young, malnourished children.Afghanistan is considered a fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable setting. The country has faced years of compounded crises, under-investment, instability and drought, and has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. According to UNICEF, 14 million people in Afghanistan are facing acute food insecurity, and an estimated 3.2 million children under five years suffer from acute malnutrition.The large and widespread outbreaks and the increasing number of reported measles cases in Afghanistan, is due to a variety of complex factors that on the one hand have resulted in the low immunization coverage of both first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2), on the other has exacerbated the impact of the outbreak (e.g. high levels of acute malnutrition, winter conditions and crowded domestic situation, previous displacement).\u00a0The 2020 WHO/UNICEF national immunization coverage estimates were 66% for MCV1 and 43% for MCV2. At the sub-national level, administrative coverage data shows that six provinces achieved less than 50% MCV1 coverage (Kandahar 40%; Paktya 38%; Jozjan 37%; Khost 36%; Helmand 18%; Urozgan 3.1%). The internal displacement of 698 000 people in 2021 was another driver of low MCV coverage. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) frequently live in conditions that increase susceptibility to measles (e.g. through less access to immunization services) and may increase measles exposures (e.g. through over-crowding) as well as experiencing poor health outcomes (e.g. due to factors like increasing risk and rates of malnutrition, poor access to curative services). Cross-border travel due to the recent instability in Afghanistan has increased the risk of international spread, particularly in Pakistan and Iran.Overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:The regional risk is considered moderate due to the movement of people to Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan, while at the global level the risk is considered low due to moderately high global MCV coverage estimates. More information is required from neighbouring countries and continued monitoring of displacement trends.Two-dose measles vaccination coverage of at least 95% in every province is recommended to ensure immunity. Strengthening routine immunization and conducting outbreak response immunization campaigns are essential for effective control of the epidemic and reducing mortality.The administration of vitamin A, particularly in the context of malnutrition, is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality.

There were 1451 reported cases and 10 deaths (CFR 0.7%) in 2020 and 901 cases and 11 deaths (CFR 1.2%) in 2021. In January 2022\nalone 1286 cases were reported, of which 790 (61.4%) were children under the age of 14 years, 142 were severe dengue cases and 20 fatalities were reported (case fatality ratio 1.6%). The majority of the cases who presented to the hospital were\ndiagnosed based on the clinical signs and symptoms. Dili municipality, which includes the capital city of Timor-Leste, reported the highest number of cases (857 cases 66.6%), followed by Manatuto municipality (92, 7.2%).Dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste year-round, with peak transmission reported from December to April during the hottest months of the year (Figure 1). The ongoing monsoon season may increase mosquito density and the likelihood of further transmission\nof dengue in the next few months. \u00a0In previous outbreaks between 2005 and 2012, two co-circulating serotypes, dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) and dengue virus 3 (DENV-3), were reported. Information on circulating serotypes has not been available\nsince 2012.Figure 1. Dengue cases reported in Timor-Leste, 1 January 2016 - 31 January 2022Source: WHO Country Office in Timor-Leste, WHO Regional Office for South-East AsiaThe Ministry of Health has undertaken several response activities including:Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is caused by four DENV serotypes (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3 and DENV 4). Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes\u00a0albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri-urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes. Sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue.Although dengue in Timor-Leste is not unexpected, the significant daily increase in the number of dengue cases and the rate of hospitalization in the current outbreak are unusual. The number of reported cases between 1 December 2021 to 31 January 2022 is substantially higher compared to the same periods in previous years since 2016. As dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste, the population may be at risk of secondary infection and possible serious complications if not treated promptly and adequately.There is no specific treatment for dengue. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue cases. Given the limited health care capacity in-country, poor access to health care, and COVID-19 and other diseases pressuring health capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts and an increased number of severe and fatal dengue cases.\u00a0Co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and DENV can also be expected.Due to strict international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, cross-border movement of people is limited. However, international spread by vectors or asymptomatic travellers cannot be ruled out because Timor-Leste shares a land border with Indonesia where dengue is also endemic and the primary vectors are present.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better detection,\u00a0increased bed capacity in hospitals, sensitized\u00a0health care providers on case management\u00a0and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness to better assess disease burden and seasonality patterns. Establishing sentinel sites for systematically testing and subtyping dengue virus will support the detection and response to dengue in affected areas.The prevention and control of dengue depends\u00a0on effective vector control.\u00a0WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0subspecies, for larvae and adult mosquitoes.\u00a0Enhanced IVM involves removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure (i.e.,\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures).\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact such as residences, workplaces, schools and hospitals.\u00a0Vector control activities can include covering, draining and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis, as well as chlorination and application of suitable larvicides/insecticides for water storage. Community-led cleaning activities should be encouraged involving community groups, students, religious groups among others. Space spraying with insecticide can be deployed as an emergency measure.Although dengue is not spread from person to person, mosquitoes can become infected after it bites someone with DENV. This cycle, therefore, makes the infected mosquito capable of spreading dengue within the household and the neighbourhood leading to clusters of cases. During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0 While indoors, WHO recommends the use of mosquito repellents,\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products or mosquito coils. Using window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites.WHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied on Timor-Leste based on the information available for this event.Citable referenceWorld Health Organization (4 February 2022).

Cases have been reported from nine departments in Benin including Alibori, Atacora, Atlantique, Borgou, Collines, Donga, Littoral, Mono and Oueme. Borgou department, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported an increase in cholera cases from week 43 (ending on 31 October) to week 50 (ending on 12 December), with 841 cases reported, of which 71% of cases (n=597) were reported from Parakou district.CoordinationMonitoringLaboratory and case managementWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)Risk CommunicationLogisticsCholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0bacteria in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is a potentially serious infectious disease that can cause high morbidity and mortality, which can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting.Cholera is endemic in Benin and since 2016, cases continue to be reported every year in various departments across the country. The Parakou district in Borgou department is the epicenter of the current outbreak with high commercial traffic to Cotonou, the capital of Benin.The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in Benin include:Additionally, Benin shares international borders with Nigeria and Togo, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Given the porous borders with countries responding to cholera outbreaks and inadequate WASH conditions, the national and regional risks of this outbreak is assessed as high while the risk at the global level is considered to be low.WHO recommends improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, good food safety and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera.Strengthening surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improved access to care, should be implemented in areas affected by the outbreak to reduce mortality. There is a need to ensure that countries are prepared to rapidly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. As the outbreak is occurring in areas with active cross border population movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to and from Benin based on the information available on the current outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Cholera"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Benin", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/hepatitis-e-virus---chad", "date_of_publication": "2022-01-17", "headline": "Hepatitis E virus - Chad", "main_text": "As of 11 January 2022, 385 suspected cases of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been reported, of which, 12 are confirmed and two associated deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 0.5%) have been reported in six villages in Lai district, Tandjile region, Chad. Health authorities began an investigation on 1 October 2021 for a cluster of 25 suspected HEV cases presenting with jaundice, fever, and epigastric pain. Of the tested samples at the Ndjamena General Hospital, 65% (13/20)\u00a0 were positive for HEV using rapid diagnostic tests. The same batch of 20 samples was referred to the Centre Pasteur in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, a WHO collaborating centre for confirmation and 12 tested positive for HEV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results for blood samples from a further 29 of the suspected cases \u00a0remain pending.Of the 385 reported cases, more than half were male (n=215; 57%). Cases aged less than 10 years (n=90; 23.4%) and 21-30 years (n=89; 23.1%) accounted for the largest proportion of cases.Heavy rain in Chad since June 2021 have greatly impacted the Tandjile region and by October 2021, approximately 161 000 people were affected. Floodwaters caused substantial infrastructural damage in a setting that has pre-existing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) challenges such as a poor access to safe drinking water and high rates of open defecation.The last known outbreak of HEV in Chad began in August 2016 and lasted for 17 months before the Ministry of Health declared the end of the outbreak in February 2018. A total of 1874 suspected HEV cases and 23 associated deaths were reported. The area affected in this outbreak was located in the Salamat region, just over 700 km north east of the current outbreak.Suspected HEV cases have been detected in Chad after nearly four years without any reported cases. Heavy rains causing flooding have created favourable conditions for HEV transmission, including a large amount of displaced people living in precarious situations where clean drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services are limited.The main risks of spread at the national level are 1) poor sanitation and hygiene practices especially in areas affected by floods; 2) high rates of open defecation; 3) lack of access to safe drinking water; and 4) presence of large internally displaced population.At a regional level, the risk of HEV transmission is currently low. However, the risk may be affected by the increased number of displaced persons in Tandjile region and from other southern regions of the country, some of which share a border with Cameroon and the Central African Republic. HEV outbreaks are currently occurring in South Sudan and Sudan, however no epidemiological links have been established with the outbreak in Chad. During the last documented outbreak in Chad which ended in 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in South Sudan showed HEV genotype 1, sub-genotype 1e, that was closely related to strains isolated in Chad and Uganda.Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the HEV. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas with humanitarian emergencies.HEV is transmitted mainly by the faecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2\u20136 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, which can be fatal. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimester, putting pregnant women at increased risk of acute liver failure, foetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality ratio can be as high as 20-25% in the last trimester of pregnancy.There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E other than general management of acute liver failure as needed, and supportive care. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required.Prevention is crucial against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV are provision of safe drinking water, and provision of adequate water and sanitation hygiene. At the individual level, risk of infection can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following other WHO hygiene practices for food safety. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources, along with community engagement should be increased in conjunction with other sanitation interventions in an aim to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene.Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat HEV epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings.As the incubation period for HEV ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe WASH promotion have been adopted.It remains important that interventions continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries.A hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risks, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Chad or any of the affected countries based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Hepatitis E virus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Chad", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/influenza-a-(h5)---united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland", "date_of_publication": "2022-01-14", "headline": "Influenza A (H5) - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "main_text": "On 6 January 2022, the International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified WHO of the detection of a laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5) from South West England.The case lived with a large number of domestically kept birds which had onset of illness on 18 December 2021, and subsequently tested positive with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) by the United Kingdom National Reference Laboratory at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge laboratory.\u00a0 As part of routine follow up of exposed persons to avian influenza cases, an upper respiratory swab was taken from the case on 24 December 2021 which tested positive for influenza A with subtyping H5. Further characterization of the virus is ongoing. This result was reproduced on two successive upper respiratory swabs collected during the following days. The case has remained clinically asymptomatic and is now considered to not be infectious.Following successful virus isolation from samples collected from birds on the infected premises, APHA analyzed full genome sequence data for the HPAI A(H5N1) virus present in these birds. Genomic analysis demonstrated that the sequence generated contained no strong correlates for specific increased affinity for humans.All contacts have been identified and managed according to the national public health protocols. None of the contacts have reported symptoms and no evidence of secondary transmission has been identified to date.The infected premises were visited by APHA personnel who completed culling of all the birds. Several measures including complete decontamination and cleaning of the outside of the property have been completed.A three-kilometer captive bird (monitoring) controlled zone was declared by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs around the infected premises. The zone will remain in place for at least 21 days following the completion of preliminary cleansing and disinfection and will not be lifted until surveillance activities including clinical inspections of all commercial premises in the\u00a0zone have been undertaken.Since 2003, a total of 863 cases and 455 deaths of influenza A(H5N1) human infection have been reported worldwide, including this case in the United Kingdom. The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in October 2020 in Lao People's Democratic Republic in a one-year-old female who had exposure to backyard poultry (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 17 November 2020).Since 1 October 2021, there have been 73 poultry cases and 471 detections in individual wild birds of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1)This is the first reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5) infection in the United Kingdom. The case remained clinically asymptomatic. The virus has not been detected beyond this single case. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate.There are no specific vaccines for preventing Influenza A(H5N1) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report (for more details, please see Case definitions for the four diseases requiring notification in all circumstances under the International Health Regulations (2005)).In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, people involved in specific high-risk activities such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litters and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on the proper use of and provided with appropriate personal protective equipment. All persons involved in these activities should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should also follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade with the United Kingdom based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Influenza A (H5)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Kingdom of Great Britain ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Northern Ireland", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---west-and-central-africa", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-23", "headline": "Yellow Fever - West and Central Africa", "main_text": "In 2021, nine countries in the WHO African Region (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Republic of Congo,) reported human laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF) in areas that are at high risk for the disease and have a history of YF transmission and outbreaks. These outbreaks are growing in case numbers, necessitating an urgent response.Since the beginning of 2021 and as of 20 December, there have been 300 probable and 88 laboratory confirmed cases of YF. Among the probable cases there have been 66 deaths reported\u00a0from six\u00a0countries (Ghana = 42; Cameroon = 8; Chad = 8; Nigeria = 4; Congo = 2; DRC = 2), the overall case fatality ratio (CFR) among the probable cases is 22%, with a very wide variation among countries e.g Ghana (40%) and Cameroon (21%).In October and November 2021, confirmed active YF outbreaks were reported in Ghana and Chad respectively and required support from the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for vaccine provision from the emergency global stockpile of YF vaccine.Among the affected countries some are classified as having a fragile, conflict-affected or vulnerable (FCV) setting, in addition to low YF population immunity. Gaps or delays in investigations of suspected YF cases due to insecurity (Chad, Cameroon, CAR) or under-served (nomadic) communities (Ghana) have implications for harm to human health and risk of onward amplification and spread.The situation is also concerning where cases have been confirmed in inaccessible health districts with weak YF surveillance, preparedness, and response systems, and significant population displacements into neighbouring countries (e.g., Cameroon, Chad, CAR). In addition, there are major urban areas such as Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire that have reported YF cases and are a high concern as they pose a significant risk of amplification mediated by Aedes aegypti person-mosquito-person transmission (without sylvatic intermediary). Urban YF outbreaks can rapidly amplify with onward spread internationally, as seen in Angola and DRC in 2016. The case count of confirmed and probable cases is rapidly evolving and has challenges to track due to the complexity of interpretation in the context of available epidemiological and clinical data, including vaccination history of the cases.The overall YF vaccination coverage in these regions is not sufficient to provide herd immunity and prevent outbreaks. Estimates from WHO and UNICEF in 2020 on routine YF vaccination coverage was 44% in the African region, much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer herd immunity against YF. The national coverage in the countries of concern were all under 80% with the exception of Ghana (88%): Congo (69%), Cote D\u2019Ivoire (69%), Niger (67%), Cameroon (57%), DRC (56%), Nigeria (54%), CAR (41%), and Chad (35%). These low YF vaccination coverages indicate the presence of an underlying susceptible population at risk of YF and a risk of continued transmission.These outbreaks are occurring in a large geographic area in the West and Central regions of Africa. These reports signal a resurgence and intensified transmission of the YF virus. The outbreaks have included areas that have previously conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaigns but with persistent and growing gaps in immunity due to lack of sustained population immunity through routine immunization and/or secondary to population movements (newcomers without history of vaccination). For example, outbreaks were identified in late 2020 in countries with a history of nationwide preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) including an outbreak in Guinea notified in November 2020 (history of PMVCs 2005, 2010) and Senegal notified in November 2020, (history of PMVCs 2007 plus reactive campaigns in 2011, 2005, 2002). In 2021, the recently confirmed outbreak in Ghana is marked by an impact on nomadic communities, despite the country having completed the final phase of PMVC in November 2020. Outbreaks and case reports of suspected, probable and/or confirmed cases are also occurring in other settings in the region where nationwide phased PMVCs are ongoing and yet to be completed (DRC, Nigeria), or yet to be initiated (Chad, Niger), further compounding the risk of spread.Another potential factor contributing to the enhanced risk is a delay in the investigation of probable cases. The investigation of probable cases has faced challenges in many of the reporting countries made complicated due to stretched resources, capacity, and logistical challenges. The health systems in the nine countries with confirmed YF, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine rollout, have been strained with many other competing acute public health outbreaks which has diverted attention from YF preparedness and response activities.The numerous YF cases and outbreaks in a broad geographic scope, with upward trend of confirmed cases and outbreaks, is indication of ongoing intense YF virus transmission in an extended area in the region and represent a persistent and growing risk to all unvaccinated people living or visiting YF high-risk countries.Countries reporting probable but no confirmed YF case in 2021Probable YF cases have also been reported from Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali, Togo, and Uganda. The most recent, with samples collected during September/October, were two cases in Port-Gentil district (Ogoou\u00e9-Maritime province), Gabon and two cases in Haho (Notse city) and Ogou (Atakpame city) health districts, Plateaux region, Togo. These samples are currently being shipped to the regional reference laboratories for confirmation.Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes sp. and Haemogogus sp). Transmission can be amplified in circumstances where the Aedes mosquitos (day feeder) are present in urban settings and densely populated areas causing a rapid spread of the disease. While many people who become infected do not experience severe symptoms, a subset will develop severe disease. Following a 3-6-day incubation period, cases develop an \u201cacute\u201d phase illness characterized by fever, muscle pain with a prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea and/or vomiting, which resolves within 3-4 days. Approximately 15% of cases enter a second \u201ctoxic\u201d phase within 24 hours of initial remission, which may include high fever, jaundice with or without abdominal pain and vomiting, haemorrhage, and kidney failure, 50% of these cases die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.The risk at regional level is assessed as high due to;The overall risk at the global level is considered low, as no cases related to this current outbreak have been reported outside of the African region, at this stage. However, there are favourable ecosystems for YF outside the African region and there might be challenges in the surveillance and immunization capacities due to potential onward transmission, if not timely detected.More than 2 billion individuals in Asia live in areas where the competent vectors A. aegypti and A. albopictus are present. The expansion of global air travel and the rapid ecological and demographic changes increase the risk of YF introductions into Asia. Based on the interconnectivity with endemic countries, studies have suggested China, India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are at the greatest risk of YF introduction; however, the risk of autochthonous transmission is unknown. There is a risk of outbreaks in urban settings, introduced by viraemic travellers to largely unprotected urban populations such as Lagos (Nigeria), N\u2019Djamena (Chad) or Bangui (CAR), with continued risk of rapid amplification internationally.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, YF vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population are closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk to the Region and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.The countries reporting YF cases and outbreaks are all high priority countries for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. These countries have introduced yellow fever vaccination into their routine immunization schedule for those aged 9 months, and also requirements of proof of vaccination against YF for all incoming travellers \u22659 months, except Chad and Nigeria, who request proof of vaccination only for travellers coming from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreaks.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers 9 months of age or older going to yellow fever high risk countries. The affected countries also require a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged 9 months or over.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. When conditions permit, the EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive YF activities according to WHO guidance.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapidly medical advice when presenting signs. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 1 July 2020; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to the region on the basis of the information available on these outbreaks.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "West ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Central Africa", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/hepatitis-e-virus-republic-of-south-sudan", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-23", "headline": "Hepatitis E Virus \u2013 Republic of South Sudan", "main_text": "Cases of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) have been consistently reported in South Sudan since 2014, with recurrent outbreaks occurring in Bentiu, Rubkona county, Unity state (central-north part of South Sudan), where a camp for internally displaced persons (IDP) is located.In 2021, the number HEV cases have risen significantly in the country, increasing from 564 reported during the triennium 2018-2020, to 1143 suspected cases with five deaths in 2021 (as of 29 November). In last two years (2020-2021), a total of \u00a01420 suspected cases were reported, of which 47 have been laboratory confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).The current 2021 outbreak is occurring in Unity State, with cases mainly being reported from Bentiu IDP camp. This led the Ministry of Health (MoH) to declare a HEV outbreak in Bentiu internally displaced people \u00a0(IDP) camp in August 2021. A proportion of cases (323; 28.3%) has been reported from outside the camp, in Bentiu and Rubkona towns, suggesting ongoing transmission in the surrounding community. \u00a0Males aged 15-44 years are being reported as the most affected group, followed by male children 1-4 years, and females aged 15-44 years. There are no cases currently hospitalized, with clinical management implemented in outpatient departments (OPD).Bentiu IDP camp hosts over 107,000 people and is divided into five sectors. HEV cases are reported from all sectors, highlighting widespread transmission.Unity State, is also affected by a flood that has caused a massive displacement and the development of new IDP sites, adding 30,000 more IDPs hosted in the Bentiu IDP camp.Leadership and coordinationSurveillanceSupportive case managementWASHCommunity engagementHEV VaccinationHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus, transmitted by the faecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. It can lead to serious public health impacts particularly among special populations: those in IDP camps and pregnant women. Risk factors for HEV are linked to poor sanitation conditions, allowing viruses excreted in the stools of infected individuals to enter water intended for human consumption.Usually, the infection resolves spontaneously within 2 to 6 weeks, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.5-4%. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and progress to fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). Generally, CFR for pregnant women is reported to be higher than the overall CFR for HEV infections, reaching 25%. Displaced persons and refugees experience the highest attack rates when outbreaks occur given the overcrowded nature of their living conditions and poor hygiene situation.Cases of HEV have consistently been reported from Bentiu IDP camp since 2014 but have risen and surpassed epidemic threshold levels in 2021.The overall risk at the global level remains low, while at the national level is assessed as high due to:As the affected area is close to the border with Sudan and Ethiopia, at the regional level the overall risk is considered moderate due to the presence of the mobile IDP populations and refugees that cross these borders. While there have been fewer documented refugees coming from Ethiopia into South Sudan, a significant amount of traffic occurs for people heading to Sudan, particularly from Rubkona county - where the Bentiu IDP camp is located - to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.Additionally, there is a current outbreak of HEV at the border with South Darfur state in Sudan, that poses potential risk of cross-border spread.There is no specific treatment for HEV. Prevention is the most effective approach against this disease.To prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in neighbourhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat HEV epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.Since the incubation period for HEV ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.Interventions must continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries.To date, a hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization, and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risks, such as pregnant women.

The declaration was made in accordance with WHO recommendations , 42-days after the second negative test of the last confirmed case.Between 8 October to 16 December, a total of 11 cases (eight confirmed, three probable) including nine deaths and two survivors have been reported from Beni HZ. Of the nine deaths, seven were in the community and two occurred at the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). The overall case fatality ratio (CFR) is 82% (9/11) among total cases while 75% (6/8) among confirmed cases.This outbreak was declared on 8 October 2021 when the index case; a 3-year-old boy developed symptoms including physical weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, breathing difficulty, dark stool and blood in their vomit and later died on 6 October (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 10 October 2021).On 7 October, samples were tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) laboratory in Beni. These were later sent to the Rodolphe M\u00e9rieux INRB Laboratory, Goma on 8 October and EVD was confirmed by RT-PCR on the same day. This event followed a cluster of three deaths (two children and their father) who were neighbours of the index case. These three patients died on 14, 19 and 29 September after developing symptoms consistent with Ebola, however, none were tested for the virus. Full genome sequencing, performed by the INRB in Kinshasa city, from the initial confirmed case indicates that this outbreak was not the result of a new zoonosis from an animal reservoir but was linked to a persistent Ebola virus infection.During the outbreak period (8 October to 16 December 2021), three (16%) of the 19 health areas in Beni HZ reported confirmed cases, namely, Butsili (six cases), Bundji (one case) and Ngilinga (one case). Children under the age of five years accounted for 50% (4/8) of all confirmed cases. To date, all contacts completed their 21-day follow-up period and were discharged from active follow-up.Additionally, from 8 October to 13 December, a total of 21 916 alerts were reported from nine health zones including 15 642 from Beni, 21 558 (98%) of which were investigated and 1709 were validated as suspected cases of EVD.The Ministry of Health (MoH), together with WHO and other partners, initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent its further spread. The MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to the field to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on the outbreak prevention and control interventions.In addition, the following public health measures were taken in response to the EVD outbreak;The current re-emergence of EVD is the fifth outbreak in less than three years. The last EVD outbreak was reported in North Kivu Province earlier this year in February and was declared over on 3 May 2021 (for more details please see the Disease Outbreak News \u00a0published on 4 May 2021)All probable and confirmed EVD cases were identified in three health areas of Beni HZ, within the densely populated city of Beni.\u00a0 WHO continues to monitor the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information is available.WHO has noted that although the current resurgence is undesirable, it is not unexpected given the fact that EVD is enzootic in the DRC and the Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region; it means that the risk of re-emergence through exposure to an animal host cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major\u00a0outbreak. The Ebola virus can persist in certain body fluids of EVD survivors. In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to survivors' body fluids have occurred. Therefore, maintaining collaborative relationships with survivor associations while monitoring survivors is a priority to mitigate any potential risk.Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are gaps in the country\u2019s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors including poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of access and security, epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19, as well as ongoing outbreaks such as cholera and measles might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/cholera-cameroon", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-16", "headline": "Cholera \u2013 Cameroon", "main_text": "Since the beginning of 2021, Cameroon has reported sporadic cases of cholera. During week 43 of 2021, ending on 31 October, health authorities declared a cholera outbreak that is currently active in the South-West region, with cases also reported from the Centre and Littoral regions. Between 25 October and 10 December 2021, these three regions reported a cumulative number of 309 suspected and 4 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, with 19 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.1%).The South-West region, reported the first two cases on 27 October in Kesse area, Bamusso commune in Ekondo Titi health district. Two stool samples were collected from the cases and tested positive for cholera by culture at the Laquintinie Hospital laboratory in Douala. As of 10 December, a cumulative number of 163 suspected cases with 7 deaths (CFR 4.3%) have been identified in Ekondo Titi health district. Sixty-six percent of cases were male and 16.6% were under the age of five. The outbreak has spread to the neighbouring health district of Bakassi, with 95 suspected cases and 11 deaths (CFR 11.6%).On 28 October 2021, the Centre region, notified a suspected case of cholera with no epidemiological link to cases reported in the South-West region, from the health area of Akok-Ndoe, Biyem-Assi health district part of the urban community of Yaound\u00e9, the capital of Cameroon. A stool sample tested positive for cholera by Rapid Diagnostic Test, and on 29 October was confirmed positive by PCR and culture for Vibrio cholerae at the Pasteur Centre of Cameroon, Yaounde. A cumulative number of 50 suspected cases and one death (CFR 2%) have been reported from Biyem-Assi health district. Of these 52% were male and 8% were under the age of five. The last case to date in the Centre region was reported on 11 November 2021.In the Littoral region, a cholera case was confirmed by culture on 21 November 2021 in an eight-year-old boy at the Laquintinie Hospital laboratory in Douala. This has remained an isolated case with no further suspected cases. His family and those in his neighbourhood also reported no history of travel.CoordinationSurveillanceLaboratory and Case managementWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)Risk Communication and Community EngagementCholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria present in contaminated water or food. In its severe form, it can lead to severe dehydration and death within hours if left untreated. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.Cholera is endemic in Cameroon. Since 2018, cholera outbreaks have been reported annually in various regions of the country including in the currently affected regions (South-West, Centre and Littoral). Several risk factors concur with the circulation of Vibrio cholera in the country, including limited access to safe drinking water and health care facilities in the affected areas of the South-West region and in the capital city of Yaound\u00e9, as well as cultural practices that contribute to unsafe WASH conditions.The Biyem-Assi health district in the Centre region is a densely populated area with insufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation, that is located in the heart of the capital city Yaound\u00e8. This may allow a cholera outbreak to spread quickly if swift control measures are not implemented.The affected health districts in the South-West region (Ekondo Titi, Bakassi and Mobonge) belong to an archipelago in a humanitarian crisis zone with an ongoing armed conflict, and the risk of cholera exportation to other neighbouring districts cannot be excluded. Security constraints, limited geographic accessibility of some areas, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. The populations have no or limited access to safe drinking water and latrines, and the overall hygienic conditions are inadequate. There is limited access to health care and patients may have to travel long distances by boat to seek care.In addition, the affected South-West region borders Nigeria, and there is a frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. In the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno and Taraba states of Nigeria which are currently affected by a cholera outbreak. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon. Therefore, the risk at the national and regional levels is assessed as high. At the global level, the risk is considered low.WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, proper waste management, food safety practices and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Key public health communication messages should be provided.Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improving access to care, should be implemented in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to decrease the risk of spread to new areas.

Secondary infections put people at greater risk of severe dengue leading to hospital admissions.\u00a0\u00a0In Pakistan, dengue fever is endemic with reports of seasonal surges of cases and circulation of the different serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) in various parts of the country. Aedes aegypti\u00a0and\u00a0A.\u00a0albopictus\u00a0are widely adapted vectors for urban and\u00a0peri urban\u00a0environments.\u00a0As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,\u00a0serious complications if not treated promptly and correctly.With the current COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0affecting\u00a0the national health system capacity, and competing communicable disease outbreaks, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better case detection,\u00a0sensitized\u00a0health care providers on case management\u00a0and improved\u00a0surveillance of acute febrile illness in Pakistan to better define disease burden and seasonality patterns.The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection.\u00a0There is no specific treatment for dengue infection, but early detection and access to appropriate healthcare reduces severe dengue and mortality.\u00a0Furthermore, the prevention and control of dengue depends\u00a0on effective sustained vector control measures.WHO promotes the strategic approach known as Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control mosquito vectors, including\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp.\u00a0(the vector of dengue) .\u00a0IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure.\u00a0This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e.,\u00a0environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies for protecting people and households.\u00a0Vector control activities should focus on all areas where there is human-vector contact (place of residence, workplaces, schools and hospitals).Vector control activities may include covering, draining, and cleaning household water storage containers on a weekly basis.Where indoor biting occurs,\u00a0application of mosquito repellent lotion or sprays on skin, use of\u00a0household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers\u00a0are recommended. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce bites. Since\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes are day biters (the primary vector for transmission) with peak\u00a0activity at dawn and dusk, personal protective measures including the\u00a0use of clothing\u00a0to minimize\u00a0skin exposure\u00a0are\u00a0recommended.\u00a0During outdoor activities, mosquito repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing.\u00a0Insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people who sleep outside or during the day (e.g.,\u00a0infants, bedridden and night\u00a0workers) including dengue patients in hospitals and at night to prevent mosquito bites.In addition, vector and human case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected areas and across the country.\u00a0Key public health messages on reducing the risk of dengue transmission among the population are expected to continue to be provided.\u00a0 Community based health workers should be sensitized on these key messages to be promoted in all affected areas.WHO does not recommend any general or trade restrictions\u00a0to\u00a0Pakistan based on the information available for this\u00a0event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Pakistan", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)-united-arab-emirates", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-13", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 United Arab Emirates", "main_text": "On 17 November 2021, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in UAE.The case is a\u00a060-year-old male from the Abu Dhabi region, UAE. He developed fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and a runny nose on 3 November and presented to hospital on 5 November. On 6 November, he was admitted to hospital where a computerized tomography\u00a0(CT) scan confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. On 11 November, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2\u00a0testing was also performed, and the results were negative. \u00a0The patient has diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia as co-morbidities. He owns a dromedary camel farm in Abu Dhabi and had a history of close contact with dromedary camels at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. No travel history was reported during the same period. The patient has recovered and was discharged following two negative tests for MERS-CoV.Since July 2013, a total of 93 cases including the current case of MERS-CoV have been reported from UAE.Upon identification, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is currently ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts at the patient\u2019s household, his camel farm and healthcare facilities. Fifty-one contacts were identified and were monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed case.All samples from close contacts of the patients tested negative for MERS-CoV. One health care worker who identified as a close contact is currently outside of UAE and has been notified and advised to self-monitor. He is asymptomatic.The veterinary authorities have been notified and an investigation of animals is ongoing.Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans but it has, so far, mainly occurred in health care settings and to a limited extent among close contacts.The notification of this additional case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information. However, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacities for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in some countries since most of the resources are redirected to prevent and control the pandemic.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. Therefore, IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. \u00a0Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, supported quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions with UAE.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-(cvdpv2)-yemen", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-09", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) \u2013 Yemen", "main_text": "On 22 November 2021, the International Health Regulations national focal point (IHR NFP) for Yemen notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in stool samples from two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Yemen.The first case, a nine-year-old girl, from Thubab district, Taiz governorate, south-western Yemen, experienced onset of paralysis on 30 August. The child had not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool samples were collected on 31 August and 2 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November, with 10 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.The second case, a 26-month-old girl, from Marib district, Marib governorate, north-east of Sana\u2019a city, experienced onset of paralysis on 1 September. The child had also not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool specimens were collected on 4 and 5 September, and VDPV2 was confirmed on 22 November with 11 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.The two districts do not share a border and are approximately 430 km apart.\u00a0The two VDPV isolates are genetically linked, and therefore, classified as cVDPV2. This is a new emergence and the viruses detected are not related to other known cVDPV2s globally.The confirmation of cVDPV2 comes in the context of an ongoing outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), which has to date paralyzed 35 children (three in 2021, 31 in 2020, and one in 2019).The last VDPV2 case in the country was reported in June 2016 in Aden governorate, southern Yemen, and was classified as ambiguous[1] VDPV2 (aVDPV2). According to the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage, polio vaccine third dose (POL3) coverage was reported to be 66% in 2020.The Ministry of Health, supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, conducted a field investigation, and started implementing the polio outbreak preparedness and response plan. In addition, AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced.The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to\u00a0 significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. \u00a0Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.The Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) convened a meeting in November 2021 on the international spread of poliovirus in multiple countries. As per the report released, the Emergency Committee expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2 to many countries and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently high.The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to\u00a0 significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa.

Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s\u00a0International Travel and Health\u00a0recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of the\u00a0Emergency Committee, the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk is strongly encouraged. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations.\u00a0To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict travel of individuals at the point of departure if not vaccinated or cannot prove their vaccination status.[1]\u00a0Ambiguous VDPV (aVDPV): a VDPV isolate from individuals or from environmental samples, without evidence of circulation and from individuals with no known immunodeficiency.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Yemen", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---ghana", "date_of_publication": "2021-12-01", "headline": "Yellow Fever - Ghana", "main_text": "From 15 October to 27 November 2021, 202 suspected cases of Yellow Fever (YF) including 70 confirmed cases and 35 deaths [Case Fatality Ratio (CFR): 17%] have been reported in four regions in Ghana (Savannah, Upper West, Bono and Oti regions). YF is endemic in Ghana and is associated with severe disease in approximately 15% of cases and a high CFR. YF cases were reported mostly from nomadic populations who had moved from Nigeria into a forest reserve in Ghana\u2019s Savannah region which is visited by tourists. The region shares porous borders with Cote d\u2019lvoire and Burkina Faso, highlighting the potential for spread outside of Ghana. The cases, age ranging from 4 months to 70 years, presented with symptoms of body pain, fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, jaundice and bleeding from the gums. Females accounted for 52% (105/202) of the cases. A YF outbreak was confirmed after three samples tested positive for YF by PCR (negative for Ebola virus disease, dengue and other viral hemorrhagic fevers) at Institute Pasteur Dakar in Senegal, the regional reference laboratory. As of 27 November, 70 out of 196 samples collected have tested positive for YF by IgM and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and results are pending for 68 samples. Plaque reduction neutralization testing was positive in 5 samples at the regional reference laboratory.Although there is high overall population immunity against YF in Ghana (88% in 2020 according to WHO-UNICEF estimates), pockets of the population, including unvaccinated nomadic people, remain at risk for YF which could result in continued YF transmission. The current outbreak investigation found settlements of newcomer populations who had arrived after the last mass campaign and were largely unvaccinated.Surveillance and laboratoryVaccinationVector ControlRisk communicationThe overall risk of YF from this event at the national, regional and global levels are assessed as moderate, moderate and low, respectively. YF is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes spp. and Haemogogus spp.). A subset of people who become infected with YF experience severe symptoms. Approximately 15% of the cases enter the second toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. The second toxic phase may be characterized by fever, jaundice, with or without abdominal pain, vomiting haemorrhage and kidney failure. Of these, 20-50% die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination offers lifelong immunity and is considered to be the most important means of preventing YF, while other strategies such as vector control are complementary. There is no specific treatment for YF, and cases receive supportive care for complications such as dehydration, renal failure and fever.The national risk was assessed as moderate due to the following reasons:The regional risk was assessed as moderate due to the favorable ecosystem in the neighboring countries and porous borders. The global risk was assessed as low, however, the Mole National Park which is located in both North and West Gonja Districts is visited by tourists, therefore there could be a risk of exportation of the virus.Ghana is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of YF. In 1992, the Government of Ghana introduced YF vaccine into the routine immunization programme for children at 9 months as part of the national YF control and elimination programme. In urban centers, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers to Ghana, aged 9 months or older. YF vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against YF extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of YF vaccine cannot be required for international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of YF signs and symptoms, and instructed to promptly seek medical advice when presenting signs. Returning travellers who are viraemic may pose a risk for establishing local transmission cycles of YF where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Ghana in relation to this event, based on available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Ghana", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON344", "date_of_publication": "2021-11-25", "headline": "Monkeypox - United States of America", "main_text": "On 16 November 2021, the IHR National Focal Point of the United States of America (USA) notified PAHO/WHO of an imported case of human monkeypox in Maryland, USA. The patient is an adult, resident of the USA, with recent travel history to Nigeria.The individual was in Lagos, Nigeria when they developed a rash. On 6 November, they travelled from Lagos, Nigeria to Istanbul, Turkey and, on 7 November, from Istanbul to Washington, D.C, USA. The patient has not been vaccinated against smallpox in the past and is currently in isolation in Maryland.Samples of skin lesions were positive on 13 November by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for orthopoxvirus-generic and non-variola orthopoxvirus at the Maryland laboratory of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN). On 16 November, the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) confirmed the diagnosis on the same two lesion specimens by PCR assays for monkeypox, and also, specifically for the West African clade of monkeypox, the strain that re-emerged in Nigeria since 2017.At this time, while the patient had remained in Lagos throughout the stay in Nigeria, the source of infection for this case is unknown.This is the second time that an imported human monkeypox case has been detected in a traveler to the USA. The first imported human case in a traveler from Nigeria was reported on 15 July 2021 (for more information on the first case, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 27 July 2021). In addition to these two cases, since 2018, six importations of human cases of monkeypox have been reported in non-endemic countries in travelers from Nigeria to Israel (one case), Singapore (one case) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (four cases). The frequency of global travel indicates that further exported cases may be expected among travelers from endemic areas / countries. Additionally, there may be cases that are undetected, misdiagnosed, or not reported.The USA CDC is working with their international health counterparts, state, and local health officials to assess potential risks and to contact airline passengers and others who may have had contact with the patient on flights from Nigeria to Turkey and onwards to the USA, in transit, or after arrival in the USA. Travelers on these flights were required to wear masks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on these flights is therefore considered low.Public health measures are being taken, including isolation and continued monitoring of the patient\u2019s clinical recovery. Possible contacts are being notified for assessment and monitoring by their local or state health department. Post-exposure vaccination with a smallpox vaccine within 14 days of the last contact with the case may be recommended for cases who are at intermediate and high risk.Healthcare providers have been advised to be vigilant to poxvirus-like lesions, particularly among travelers returning from Nigeria. Because of the public health risks associated with a single case of monkeypox, clinicians should report suspected cases immediately to state or local public health authorities regardless of whether they are also exploring other potential diagnoses.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that belongs to the\u00a0Orthopoxvirus\u00a0family. Genomic sequencing shows there are two monkeypox clades \u2013 Congo Basin and West African\u00a0and there have been observed differences in human pathogenicity and mortality in the two geographic areas. Both clades can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets or contact with fomites such as bedding; infection can be fatal in humans.The incubation period for monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days. The disease is often self-limiting with signs and symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within two to four weeks. Signs and symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be painful. Immune deficiency, young age, and pregnancy appear to be risk factors for severe disease. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the West African clade has been reported to be around 1%. The recent outbreak in Nigeria recorded a higher CFR related to underlying conditions which may lead to immunodeficiency. A case fatality ratio of up to 11% (in individuals without prior smallpox vaccination) has been reported for the Congo basin clade.Since 2017, a monkeypox outbreak has been occurring in Nigeria with 218 cases confirmed to date. In addition to Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in nine other countries in central and western Africa since 1970. These include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Sudan. Sporadic small outbreaks continue to occur in some of these countries including Cameroon and the Central African Republic. However, the vast majority of cases continue to be reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 2780 cases and 72 deaths (CFR 2.6%) reported between 1 January through 31 October 2021.While a new vaccine has been approved for the prevention of monkeypox, and traditional smallpox vaccine has been demonstrated to provide protection, these vaccines are not widely available. Increased susceptibility of humans to monkeypox is thought to be related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or use of animal-derived products are presumed sources of human infection. Milder cases of monkeypox in adults could go undetected, misdiagnosed, or unreported and represent a risk of human-to-human transmission.There is likely to be little immunity to infection in those exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to West and Central Africa and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox disease, and care is symptom-based optimal care. In some circumstances, treatment approved for smallpox may be offered on a compassionate or emergency use basis.Any illness during travel in an endemic area or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travelers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick, dead, or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (mammals including rodents, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game or use of products derived from animals. The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.A patient with monkeypox should be isolated during the infectious period, just prior to and including the rash stage of the infection and until all lesions have crusted and fallen off. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of endemic and imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential parts of preventing secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks.Treatment for monkeypox is optimal care based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and clinical condition.Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to or trade with Nigeria, Turkey or the USA based on available information at this point in time.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United States of America", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-(cvdpv2)-ukraine", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-22", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) \u2013 Ukraine", "main_text": "On 2 October 2021, WHO was notified of the isolation of poliovirus in the samples from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case in Ukraine.

The last reported VDPV was classified as VDPV2 in Ukraine\u2019s Odesa province in 2016. The virus isolated from the current reported case in Rivne is not related to the 2015 outbreak or 2016 isolates.The national immunization coverage with three doses of polio vaccine (POL3) in Ukraine was 83% in 2020.The Ministry of Health led multi-disciplinary emergency task force has been established to coordinate the public health response. Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), including WHO, are providing support to authorities at national and subnational levels. This support includes outbreak investigation, intensified surveillance, and raising public awareness.Supplemental vaccination of all young children in the affected area is planned to ensure catch-up for any eligible children who may have missed routine polio vaccination and ensure that all are protected from the disease.The risk of national spread is assessed as high due to historically low immunization coverage rates in Ukraine and the existing subnational vaccination gaps. Although AFP surveillance is sensitive enough to detect paralytic cases, poliovirus transmission may continue undetected.The risk of international spread of this virus is currently assessed as low due to the relatively high immunization coverage and sanitary infrastructure in neighboring countries, particularly Belarus, Hungary, and Slovakia. However, the European Regional Commission for Certification of Polio Eradication expressed concern about the quality of polio surveillance and suboptimal vaccination coverage in Poland and Romania.It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates at subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel.Countries affected by poliovirus circulation are subject to temporary recommendations issued by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations on Polioviruses, due to the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The latest report by the Committee is from August 2021.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Ukraine", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/zika-virus-disease-india", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-14", "headline": "Zika Virus Disease \u2013 India", "main_text": "On 8 July 2021, a Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was laboratory-confirmed in a resident of Kerala state, south-west India. This represents the first Zika virus disease case ever reported from Kerala. ZIKV viral RNA was detected through RT-PCR testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, in a blood sample collected from the patient, a 24-year-old pregnant woman in her third trimester of pregnancy resident in Trivandrum district. On 28 June 2021, she was admitted to a private hospital with arbovirus like symptoms of fever, headache and general rash. Laboratory results were negative for dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The woman delivered on 7 July, she was reportedly in good health and there were no apparent birth defects in the new-born. In the 3 months before delivery, she had resided in Trivandrum district not having traveled during that period. Among her close contacts, her mother reported having fever and similar symptoms one week before ZIKV confirmation in her daughter.Retrospective testing was conducted among 19 hospital staff and patients at the same private hospital who had previously presented with fever, myalgia, arthralgia and petechial lesions in May 2021. Blood samples collected from these 19 ZIKV suspected cases were sent to NIV Pune, and on 10 July the laboratory results confirmed that 13 of the 19 samples tested positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR, indicating cryptic transmission of ZIKV in Kerala state since May 2021.During the period from 8 to 26 July 2021, 590 blood samples were collected in Kerala state through active case finding and passive surveillance. Of them, 70 (11.9%) tested positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR at NIV Pune, including four additional pregnant women. All these cases were from Trivandrum district, except two cases reported from Ernakulam and Kottayam districts, who both had recent travel history to Trivandrum district.On 31 July 2021, Maharashtra state also reported its first Zika laboratory-confirmed case from Belsar, a village of 3500 inhabitants located in Purandar Taluka administrative unit, Pune district. The case, a 50-year-old women, tested positive for both ZIKV (by RT-PCR and sero-neutralization) and CHIKV (by RT- PCR and IgM ELISA) at NIV Pune. Fifty-one additional samples from ZIKV suspected cases were collected from Belsar village, of them 40 tested negative for ZIKV and 11 are still pending for results.So far, no cases of microcephaly and/or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been linked with this outbreak.The Kerala Health department, along with local self-government health departments has implemented the following response activities:ZIKV can cause large epidemics with a substantial demand on the public health system including surveillance, case management, and laboratory capacity to differentiate ZIKV disease from illness due to co-circulating mosquito-borne viruses like dengue and chikungunya. Although 60-80% of the Zika virus infected cases are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, ZIKV can cause microcephaly, congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and GBS. Moreover, although ZIKV is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, it can also be transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and organ transplantation.In India, ZIKV disease cases/infections have been detected in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan states in 2018 (South-East Asian lineage), but no ZIKV-associated microcephaly has been reported. Although this event is not unexpected, given the wide distribution of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and competent vector, Aedes albopictus, in Kerala and Maharashtra states, this is unusual as it is the first time that ZIKV disease cases have been confirmed in these states.The overall risk is considered low at the regional level and global level, while at the national level (Kerala and Maharashtra States) is currently assessed as moderate, given that:Protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent ZIKV infection. Special attention should be given to the prevention of mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children.Aedes mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and workplaces. It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites by appropriate methods, including: covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flower pots, and cleaning up trash and used tires. Community initiatives are essential to support local government and public health programmes to reduce mosquito breeding sites. Health authorities may also advise the use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread. Semi-urban areas should prevent the breeding of Aedes spp., in rubber plantations and other stagnant pools of water.Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high-risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include the use of repellents, wearing light coloured, long-sleeved shirts and pants, ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.For regions with active transmission of ZIKV, all persons with suspected ZIKV infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of ZIKV.WHO recommends that sexually active men and women be correctly counselled about ZIKV infection and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant in order to prevent congenital Zika syndrome and other possible adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes.Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant due to concerns about ZIKV infection should have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling. Pregnant women should practice safer sex (including correct and consistent use of condoms) or abstain from sexual activity for the entire duration of pregnancy. Pregnant women should be encouraged to attend scheduled appointments and enhanced antenatal care and follow-up, including ultrasound imaging to detect microcephaly and other developmental anomalies associated with ZIKV infection in pregnancy, in accordance with the state/national response plan.For regions with no active transmission of ZIKV, WHO recommends practicing safer sex or abstinence for a period of six months for men and two months for women who are returning from areas of active ZIKV transmission to prevent infection of their sex partners. Sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas where local transmission of ZIKV occurs, should practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity throughout pregnancy.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Zika Virus Disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "India", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/yellow-fever---bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-13", "headline": "Yellow Fever- Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)", "main_text": "On 1 October 2021, the IHR National Focal Point (NFP) for Venezuela reported seven confirmed human cases of yellow fever which were investigated between 23 and 24 September 2021. All seven caes were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Rafael Rangel National Hygiene Institute. Six of the seven reported cases were not vaccinated. Of these, three were asymptomatic and four developed signs and symptoms between 20 to 24 September, all presented fever and one of the cases also presented with a headache, retro ocular pain, arthralgias and a skin rash. The probable location of infection was a rural parish locality, south of the Matur\u00edn Municipality in the Monagas State, which is in the northeast region of Venezuela. The first reported case was a young pregnant woman with a history of yellow fever vaccination. Of the remaining six cases, five were male and ranged between 24 and 82 years of age.To date, no deaths have been reported among the confirmed cases.Additionally, between 11 August and 1 October 2021, 10 epizootics among non-human primates (NHP) were reported in Venezuela as part of the routine national surveillance. Seven epizootics were located in Monagas state (in the municipalities of Maturin and Aguasay (70 km from Maturin municipality) and three in Anzo\u00e1tegui state (Freites Municipality, 159 km from Maturin municipality). Two of the epizootics were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory (LNR) both reported in Monagas State and eight (five from Monagas and three from Anzo\u00e1tegui) were confirmed by an epidemiological link (given the time-space relationship with laboratory confirmed epizootics). Confirmed epizootics were identified at 35 km and 150 km from the urban area of Matur\u00edn within the state of Monagas.National and local health authorities in Venezuela\u00a0are implementing public health measures, including the following:Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV) and is transmitted by infected mosquitoes of the genera\u00a0Haemagogus\u00a0and\u00a0Sabethes, as well as the urban mosquito species\u00a0Aedes aegypti.\u00a0 Yellow fever infects humans and non-human primates (NHP) and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection as the disease is preventable with a single dose of yellow fever vaccine which provides immunity for life. While there is no specific treatment, supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections can reduce mortality and is recommended. Viraemic cases should stay under mosquito nets during the day to limit the risk of spread to others through bites of mosquitoes, and vector control strategies may complement particularly during outbreaks.Venezuela is considered high risk for yellow fever with endemic virus transmission and is a priority country for the global Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. Vaccination coverage is suboptimal, creating a high risk for onward transmission and amplification of yellow fever among unvaccinated populations.The increased number of human cases and epizootics since August 2021, is concerning due to the persistence of high viral circulation. Since November 2020, when the vaccination campaign began in prioritized states, 82% immunization coverage has been achieved, with five out of the 10 states with 100% coverage (Amazonas, Apure, Delta Amacuro, Sucre and T\u00e1chira). The remaining five states vary in vaccine coverage (Anzo\u00e1tegui 97.2%, Gu\u00e1rico 95.5%, Bol\u00edvar 78.9%, Monagas 67.7%, and Zulia 44.7%). The state where the outbreak has occurred, Monagas state, has low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant population remains at-risk with a necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.Despite the significant efforts made to vaccinate a large portion of the population, the increasing number of human cases and the persistence and geographical spread of epizootics among NHP illustrate the potential risk of further spread to areas where YF immunization coverage is low. Special attention should also be placed on specific at-risk groups and ethnic minorities. There is a long-standing pattern of movements of indigenous people across borders among settlements of the same culture, including to neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago. According to the International Organization for Migration[i], the flow of Warao people moving from their villages in Venezuela to Brazil, to Guyana and possibly to Suriname has increased dramatically since 2017 and persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Monagas State and national level governments along with the PAHO/WHO field team carried out activities to intensify surveillance among NHPs and entomological populations, as well as vector control in urban areas. However, epizootic and entomological surveillance needs to be strengthened in the affected and surrounding areas where human cases were detected.The yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela is occurring in the context of a major and complex situation, which includes the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic creates a risk of disruption access to health care due to COVID-19 related burdens on the health system, lack of health workers along with decreased vaccination demand due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.The capacity of local laboratories and national reference laboratories may also be compromised due to the increased demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 13 October, Venezuela reported 384 668 COVID 19 cases and 4634 deaths, and currently is among the eight countries with the highest number of COVID-19 new cases in the last 24 hours in the Region of the Americas.All yellow fever endemic and high risk regions and territories are also experiencing ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the addition of YFV as a co-circulating virus could pose an additional challenge for case management and infection and prevention control activities if there was a large scale yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela or neighbouring countries.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.The reported YF cases illustrate the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in endemic high-risk areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission.Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. Vaccination coverage should be increased particularly in people living and working in forested areas, who are exposed during the day to sylvatic vectors (Haemagogus spp\u00a0and\u00a0Sabethes spp\u00ad). Vaccination coverage should also be increased among indigenous populations, migrants and other vulnerable populations who often live in densely populated urban areas (with a risk of urban local transmission via Aedes agyepti) or participate in activities in forested areas (with a risk of sporadic cases or clusters in a sylvatic context).WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers over 9 months old at least 10 days prior to travel to Venezuela (see map here). Venezuela does not request a vaccination certificate for incoming travellers.Yellow fever vaccination recommended by WHO is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. The EYE strategy promotes maintaining and improving vaccination against YF of all eligible children in routine services and supports campaigns for large-scale populations where required according to WHO guidelines for implementation in COVID-19.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice when presenting with any of them. Infected (viraemic) returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Venezuela on the basis of the information available on this event.Framework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19XXVI Meeting of PAHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.

Earlier this year, an EVD\u00a0outbreak affected North Kivu Province which was declared over on 3 May 2021.The case was a 3-year-old male who, in early October, developed symptoms including physical weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, breathing difficulty,\u00a0dark stool\u00a0and blood in their vomit. He died on 6 October.On\u00a07\u00a0October 2021, samples were\u00a0tested at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) laboratory in Beni for molecular\u00a0analysis. These were later sent to the Rodolphe\u00a0M\u00e9rieux\u00a0INRB Laboratory, Goma\u00a0on 8\u00a0October and EVD was confirmed by\u00a0reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\u00a0(RT-PCR) on the same day.This follows a cluster of three deaths (two children and their father) who were neighbours of the case. These three patients died on 14, 19 and 29 September after developing\u00a0symptoms consistent with Ebola, however, none were tested for the virus.The first of these cases, a child, was taken to a local health\u00a0center\u00a0for fever, physical weakness and headache between 5-7 September\u00a02021 in the\u00a0Butsili\u00a0Health Area. Her condition improved and she returned home. However, on 12 September, she was re-admitted to the same health\u00a0center\u00a0with diarrhoea and vomiting and tested positive for malaria by Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). She died on the 14 September.The child\u2019s father had onset of symptoms on 10 September. He consulted another health facility on 14 September and later was admitted to a hospital in Beni. He died on 19 September.On 27 September, the child's sister developed similar symptoms. She was taken to a local health centre and later referred to another health facility where she tested positive for malaria by RDT and was treated for severe malaria. She died on 29 September.The Beni Health Zone was informed about these three deaths on 30 September.\u00a0A joint investigation team, comprising members of the Beni Health Zone and WHO, was deployed to further investigate and list the contacts.\u00a0Two samples were collected to test for COVID-19 but no samples were taken for EVD testing. \u00a0No safe and dignified\u00a0burials\u00a0were\u00a0conducted.\u00a0\u00a0Severe malaria, EVD, measles and meningitis were retrospectively listed as potential causes.Butsili\u00a0Health Area is close to Beni city, which was one of the epicentres of the 2018\u20132020 Ebola outbreak in the country with 736 probable and confirmed cases reported. It is about 50 km from Butembo city, which experienced a new Ebola outbreak earlier this year. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak, but it is too early to say whether this case is related to the\u00a0previous\u00a0outbreaks. The city of Beni is a commercial hub with links to the\u00a0neighbouring\u00a0countries of Uganda and Rwanda.The North Kivu Provincial health authorities are leading the current response. The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, is investigating the most recent case.\u00a0During\u00a0the\u00a0previous\u00a0outbreaks in North Kivu, WHO helped build the\u00a0capacity\u00a0of local laboratory technicians, contact tracers, vaccination teams, and reached out to community groups to raise Ebola awareness and engaged them in response interventions, as well as in establishing an Ebola survivor care programme.Among the WHO staff supporting the response is a focal point for the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, WHO will ensure mandatory pre-deployment training and refresher training for any further deployments; reporting channels for alerts or complaints; prompt investigation of complaints; and monitoring.As of 9 October, a total of 148 contacts have been identified and are under follow up by the response team.According to the available information, the three suspected cases and the confirmed case were admitted in several health facilities where infection prevention and control measures (IPC) might not have been optimal, which increases the risk of spread. In addition, they were buried without following safe and dignified burials protocols. Additionally, as mentioned above, the cases are from a health zone that is located within the densely populated city of Beni. Therefore, there is a risk of EVD spread to other health zones.WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.The current resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is enzootic (present in animal reservoirs) in the DRC including this region. The risk of re-emergence through exposure to an animal host or body fluids of Ebola survivors cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major\u00a0outbreak.Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are gaps in the country\u2019s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors including poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.Another challenge stretching the limited resources is the concurrent COVID-19 outbreak. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was registered in DRC on 14 March 2020. As of 5 October 2021, DRC had reported 57 197 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1 087 deaths.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of access and security, epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19, as well as cholera, meningitis, and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence of EVD cases.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON336", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-01", "headline": "Yellow Fever \u2013 Nigeria", "main_text": "Since September 2017, yellow fever cases have been reported across several states in Nigeria. From 1 January to 31 August 2021, a total of 1,312 suspected cases were reported in 367 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).A total of 45 blood samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD) and 31 samples tested positive by Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Of these 31 PRNT positive cases, twelve cases had a history of yellow fever vaccination. Two deaths were reported among the remaining 19 non-vaccinated PRNT positive cases (Case fatality ratio: 11%). These 19 PRNT positive cases were reported from: Enugu (seven cases), Anambra (three cases), Benue (three cases), Delta (two cases), Oyo (two cases) Niger (one case) and Osun (one case) State. Investigations into the PRNT-positive cases are ongoing.Nigeria has documented gaps in population immunity against yellow fever. \u00a0According to WHO-UNICEF 2020 estimates, the national immunization coverage for yellow fever was 54% in 2020 which is below the threshold of 80% necessary to protect against outbreaks. In the nine states reporting PRNT positive cases, the routine immunization coverage declined between 2018 and 2020 and was below 80% in 2020. \u00a0These states include Anambra, Benue, Delta, Enugu, Imo, Niger, Ondo, Osun and Oyo. Six states reported coverage below 50% (Anambra, Delta, Enugu, Imo, Osun, and Oyo states).Between 2019 and 2020, preventive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in six (all LGAs) of the nine states. Coverage was reported to be high (>90%) in Delta and Ondo States but lower (<80%) in Anambra, Benue, Niger, Osun and Oyo States. Additionally, in Enugu State, nine out of 17 LGAs organized reactive mass vaccination campaigns in 2020, while in Imo State, mass vaccination activities have not been organized in recent years.In addition, yellow fever surveillance is sub-optimal. Not all suspected cases are documented, presumptive positive cases are not always investigated, and investigations of confirmed cases and confirmatory testing results are delayed. Additionally, vaccination status which is critical for interpretation of laboratory results and case confirmation may not be reported as part of the investigation.Yellow fever response activities are coordinated by Nigeria Center for Disease Control through a multi-agency Yellow Fever Technical Working Group. The current response includes the following:Nigeria is a high-risk country for yellow fever and is recognized as a high priority country to the global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. The re-emergence of yellow fever in September 2017 in Nigeria has been marked by outbreaks over a wide geographical area. A combination of vaccination and vector control strategies is the most important means of preventing infection. Yellow fever is endemic in Nigeria and, due to suboptimal immunization coverage in most states and nationwide, the risk of spread is high. Entomological investigations have confirmed the presence of the vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africanus in several states across the country.Given the low routine immunization coverage, coupled with the poor performance of reactive mass immunization activities, indicate an ongoing risk in susceptible populations and thus, a risk of serious public health impact.To address the risk, the country has engaged in a multi-year plan to complete preventive mass vaccination campaigns targeting all eligible persons aged 9 months to 44-year-old, supported through the EYE and global partners. Since 2017, a total of 22 of 36 states including FCT have completed these campaigns. National and State public health authorities are currently responding to several concurrent outbreaks (COVID-19 pandemic, Lassa fever, and a widespread cholera epidemic), which are straining the available limited resources, especially human resources to conduct investigations and response activities. Additionally, the recent relaxation of COVID-19 measures could increase population mobility and the potential risk for spreading yellow fever to urban areas.Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. The disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Although there is no specific treatment, supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections can reduce mortality and is recommended. Viraemic cases should stay under mosquito nets during the day to limit the risk of spread to others through bites of mosquitoes.Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization in 2004. However, due to sub-optimal yellow fever vaccination coverage, population immunity in most areas around the country remains below herd immunity thresholds (\u226580%). The EYE Strategy was launched in Nigeria in 2018, yet its implementation at the national and sub-national level remains low. Preventive campaigns for yellow fever are being implemented in Nigeria in six phases. The target is to accelerate and complete these vaccination campaigns nationwide by 2024.As yellow fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is a priority country for the EYE strategy. Accelerated phased vaccination campaigns are planned to cover the entire country by 2024. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers from 9 months of age going to Nigeria. Nigeria requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for all travellers aged 9 months or over as a condition of entry.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapid medical advice when presenting signs. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 1 July 2020 and are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria based on the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Nigeria", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/plague---madagascar", "date_of_publication": "2021-10-01", "headline": "Plague - Madagascar", "main_text": "On 29 August 2021, the Public Health, Epidemiological Surveillance and Response Department of the Ministry of Health, Madagascar received an alert from Arivonimamo health district, Itasy region, regarding a suspected community death and 15 suspected cases of pneumonic plague that occurred in the municipality of Miandrandra. All the cases presented with fever, headache, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain and cough. Plague is endemic in Madagascar and outbreaks occur regularly, although every outbreak is cause for concern. Furthermore, pneumonic plague is a notifiable disease under the International Health Regulations 2005.By the following day, 30 August, 25 suspected cases of pneumonic plague had been notified to the health authorities from Arivonimamo district, Itasy region, including six deaths (three community deaths and three at Miandrandra health facility), 19 of which were admitted at Miandrandra health facility for treatment. A total of 20 samples (8 sputum and 12 blood) were collected the same day for laboratory confirmation at the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar.As of 15 September 2021, a total of 20 suspected and 22 confirmed cases of plague have been notified. The median age of cases is 36 years (range 3 to 74 years), 22 cases are males and 20 are females. Reported cases are geographically located in two non-bordering regions: Itasy (3 affected municipalities in Arivonimamo district) and Haute Matsiatra (1 affected municipality in Ambalavao district). Both regions are known plague endemic areas, and during the 2017 outbreak they were highly affected with Ambalavao being the main epicenter.Among confirmed cases, 19 have clinically presented as pneumonic plague and three as bubonic plague. Eight deaths occurred among confirmed cases (2 among bubonic plague cases and 6 among pneumonic plague cases) leading to a case fatality ratio of 37% (8/22). Of them, 4 were males and 4 females, 3 occurred in the community level and 5 at health facilities.Overall, 1,064 close contacts of cases have been identified, followed up, and received chemoprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole or doxycycline. Active case finding in the communities was undertaken in all the health districts reporting cases. Health authorities, in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, carried out animal surveillance in Arivonimamo district during the initial investigation on 30 August. Preliminary results showed a carriage of Yersinia pestis, the causative bacterium, in 1.3% of the rats, exceeding the alert threshold of 1%, while the pulicidal index (the ratio between the total number of fleas collected from rats captured over the total number of rats captured) was 1.7, which did not exceed the alert threshold of more than 5. Analyses were also performed in Faratsiho (Vakinakaratra region) and Besarety (Analamanga region), which are part of the endemic regions, resulting in a pulicidal indexes at 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.Interventions against pneumonic plague outbreaks are carried out by the local teams at the community level under the supervision of the district and regional teams. These teams are supported by the central level of the Ministry of Health, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar and a number of partners including WHO. The following are actions taken and activities carried out for the management and control of this outbreak:Diagnosis and case management:Coordination:Epidemiology and surveillance:Preventative measures:Community engagement:Plague is endemic in Madagascar and cases are reported each year in bubonic and pneumonic forms. The favorable season for transmission of the disease generally lasts from September to April. Cases are usually reported from the central highlands of the country, located at an altitude of over 700 meters, as is the situation with the current outbreak involving the regions of Itasy and Haute Matsiatra. Between 200 and 400 cases of plague are usually notified each year by the Ministry of Public Health, mainly in the bubonic form.The country experienced an epidemic of pneumonic plague in 2017, which was unusual because of its magnitude and its urban character affecting major cities of the country.This form of plague is very severe and almost always fatal if it is not treated promptly. It develops either by inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected person or as a result of untreated bubonic plague after the bacteria have spread to the lungs.Madagascar has a long history of responding to plague outbreaks. It has already adopted several prevention and response plans, such as the National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Plague. Unfortunately, the weak financial capacity of the country prevents the establishment of an adequate preparedness and response strategy. The existence of other epidemics like COVID-19 and the ongoing humanitarian nutrition and food crisis in the south of the country are straining the health system and reducing the country's capacity to cope with other crises. The affected areas are geographically close to the capital of the country and the movement of the population increases the risk of spreading the disease to urban areas and other areas of the country.Thus, the risk at the national level is considered high, while at the regional and global levels this risk is low since there is no known history of exporting plague cases to other countries. Additionally, as Madagascar is an island country, the implementation of response measures is particularly effective at preventing the export of cases.WHO recommends the following actions for the management of plague outbreaks:Find and eliminate the source of infection: Identify the most likely source in the area where the human cases have been reported, typically looking for clustered areas where small animals have died in large numbers. Put in place appropriate procedures to prevent and fight infection. Control vectors and rodents. Rodent control should only be undertaken after effective disinfection measures have been implemented.Protect health workers: inform them and train them in infection prevention and control. Those in direct contact with patients with pneumonic plague should apply enhanced protective measures (personal protective equipment) and take antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for at least seven days or as long as exposure to infected patients lasts.Ensure rapid and appropriate treatment: check that adequate antibiotic therapy is administered to patients and that there are sufficient stocks of antibiotics locally.Isolate patients with pneumonic plague: patients with pneumonic plague should wear a mask as long as their clinical condition allows.Monitor and protect: identify and monitor close contacts of pneumonic plague patients and administer chemoprophylaxis for 7 days. Depending on the circumstances of the contamination, members of a household where patients with bubonic plague live should also receive chemoprophylaxis as they are also likely to have been bitten by infected fleas.Collect the necessary samples according to the clinical form (blood, pus, sputum) using appropriate procedures to prevent and control infection, and send them as soon as possible to the laboratory for analysis. This procedure should not delay the start of antibiotic therapy.Perform dignified and safe burials: a person who has died of plague, regardless of the form of the disease, presents a risk of contagion. The body should only be handled by personnel trained in this task.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Madagascar", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/nipah-virus-disease---india", "date_of_publication": "2021-09-24", "headline": "Nipah virus disease - India", "main_text": "On 4 September 2021, the Kerala State Health department reported an isolated case of Nipah virus disease in Kozhikode district, Kerala state, India. Nipah has a relatively high case fatality ratio, and is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the South East Asia and Western Pacific WHO Regions. This is the fifth outbreak of the disease in India.On 29 August, a 12 year-old boy developed low grade fever, and the family sought care at a local health care facility. On 31 August, he was transferred to several hospitals as his condition deteriorated. On 1 September, the patient\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate, and the family requested his transfer to another hospital in Kozhikode.On 3 September, plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, India. On 4 September, the\u00a0 presence of Nipah virus in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM antibodies was confirmed in the plasma sample by ELISA serology test. On 5 September, the patient died and a safe burial and cremation were performed the same day in Kozhikode.As of 6 September, epidemiological investigations identified contacts, including health care workers and close family members, who were placed under quarantine.The following public health responses were implemented:Nipah virus disease is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South East Asia and Western Pacific Regions, where Pteropus fruit bats, the natural host of the virus, are widespread. It was first identified during an outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and all subsequent outbreaks have occurred in parts of Asia (India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore). Transmission can occur from direct contact with infected animals, consuming contaminated food products or through close contact with an infected person. Previous outbreaks had a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring, associated with several factors such as the breeding season of the bats, increased virus shedding by bats and fruit harvesting season. The case fatality ratio ranges from 40 to 100%.In India, the first Nipah virus disease outbreak was reported in Siliguri town in 2001, followed by a second outbreak in Nadia district in 2007, both in West Bengal state. In 2018, an outbreak was reported in Kozhikode district, and in 2019, another outbreak in Kochi district, both in Kerala state. Bats from the Pteropus spp. were the probable source of the 2018 outbreak in Kerala state.The current isolated case was reported in a rural area in Kerala state where an outbreak was previously reported in 2018. India has experienced and contained Nipah virus disease outbreaks in the past and has demonstrated the capacity to carry out outbreak control activities, including case identification, laboratory testing, case management, contact tracing and risk communication. This event is an isolated case and the risk is low at national level and low at the regional level.While there are no licensed vaccines or treatments available, experimental monoclonal antibodies have been developed to treat Nipah virus disease under compassionate use. Case management should focus on the delivery of supportive care measures to patients. Intensive supportive care is recommended for patients with severe respiratory and neurologic complications.There is evidence of Nipah virus disease among several species of domestic animals including dogs, cats, goats, sheep and horses. Nipah virus disease can be prevented by avoiding exposure to bats and sick animals in endemic areas, and avoiding consumption of fruits partially eaten by bats, and avoiding drinking raw date palm sap/toddy/juice. The risk of infection and international transmission via fruit or fruit products, such as raw date palm sap/toddy/juice contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats can be prevented by washing them thoroughly and peeling them before consumption.In health care settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health care workers caring for a patient suspected to have Nipah virus disease should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing.Safe and dignified burial is required for all confirmed and suspected cases of Nipah virus disease.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on India based on the current information related to this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Nipah virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "India", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON334", "date_of_publication": "2021-09-20", "headline": "Meningitis - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "In early July 2021, an alert of a suspected outbreak was raised to the Health Division of Tshopo Province in the north-eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The initial alert followed an increase in deaths among people presenting with symptoms including fever, headache, and stiff neck, and some with bloody diarrhea. Samples of blood and stool were collected and tested for Ebola virus disease, shigellosis and salmonellosis. These tested negative on 19 August by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) lab in Kinshasa.Meningitis was suspected and as of 16 September, a\u00a0 total of 37 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sent from the University Clinics Laboratory of Kisangani to INRB lab in Kinshasa. Of these, seven were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris on 1 September from Kinshasa, and were confirmed to be Neisseria meningitidis by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 6 September. Additional testing (serotyping) was conducted on these samples from 6 to 13 September, which were identified as Serogroup W by Pasteur Institute Lab in Paris . The remaining 30 samples are planned to be sent to Pasteur Institute, Paris.Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that this strain of meningococcus was susceptible to Ceftriaxone. Preliminary retrospective investigations suggested that the outbreak started in early June in two mining areas in Banalia Health Zone in the north of Kisangani, the capital of Tshopo Province. This outbreak is currently active and cases continue to be reported.The national health authorities, in coordination with WHO, are providing support in responding to this event. \u00a0The response measures include\u00a0the following:Since 2015, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported a high number of suspected cases of meningitis. Parts of the country lie within the African meningitis belt\u00a0[1], where bacterial meningitis is endemic and also experiences epidemics, with 6000 to 10,000 suspected cases reported annually. However, only a very small proportion (0-2%) of cases are laboratory confirmed each year.From 1 January to 1 August 2021, the DRC reported a cumulative total of 3,842 suspected cases including 189 deaths, representing a case-fatality ratio of 5%.In Tshopo Province, which is in the African meningitis belt, the last meningitis epidemic was reported in November 2009, with 214 cases and 18 deaths (case-fatality ratio of 8%). In May 2016, the province organised a preventive vaccination campaign against meningitis A during which almost 1.7 million people aged between 1 and 29 years were vaccinated. Since then, passive surveillance has been implemented in the province as part of integrated disease surveillance.Meningococcal meningitis is associated with a high case-fatality ratio (up to 50% when left untreated) and a high incidence (over 10%) of severe sequelae. The current event has already affected 608 people , with 161 deaths. The number of cases and deaths is expected to increase given the infectiousness and lethality of bacterial meningitis.Logistical challenges, in addition to accessing and communicating with many areas within the health zone, further prevents implementation of an adequate response.Additionally, the country is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which is impacting the health systems and disease surveillance capacities; and the existence of other ongoing epidemics in the country is limiting resources for the response to the meningitis outbreak.At the national level, there is a high risk of the disease spreading to other health zones and to the city of Kisangani, the capital of Tschopo province, due to the movement of people between the affected area and other parts of the country.At the regional level, the risk is assessed to be moderate due to the cross-border movements between the populations of the Central African Republic and the Tshopo province, and more than 100 mining sites in Banalia where people from neighbouring provinces and the Central African Republic travel for work. Although cross-border measures against COVID-19 may limit the travel and also enhance detection of symptomatic cases.The risk at global level is assessed to be low.It is necessary to strengthen the country\u2019s capacity and provide necessary means for diagnosis in order to respond to the current epidemic in an effective manner. Adequate logistics, proper training of health care workers on case identification and notification, and conducting risk communications in the affected health areas to heighten community awareness on measures to prevent transmission of meningitis, what symptoms should be monitored, and when to seek care, as well as strengthening community surveillance and lab capacity are critical in order to organize the response.Additionally, the country should prepare and conduct a rapid meningitis W vaccination campaign for at-risk populations.Authorities should strengthen clinical management with ceftriaxone, provide psychosocial care for patients and families, and monitor patients affected by sequelae during and after the disease.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade with the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the information available on the current outbreak.[1]\u00a0A\u00a0region in sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0where the rate of incidence of meningitis is very high.

In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days after the safe and dignified burial of the only confirmed patient reported in this outbreak. This was the first-ever Marburg virus disease case reported in Guinea.From 3 August 2021 to the end of outbreak declaration, only one confirmed case was reported.\u00a0 The patient, a man, had onset of symptoms on 25 July. On 1 August he went to a small health facility near his village, with symptoms of fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain and gingival hemorrhage. A rapid diagnostic test for malaria returned a negative result, and the patient received ambulatory supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment. Upon returning home, his condition worsened, and he died on 2 August. An alert was subsequently raised by the sub-prefecture public health care facility to the prefectorial department of health in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. The investigation team was immediately deployed to the village to conduct an in-depth investigation and collected a post-mortem oral swab sample, which was shipped on the same day to the viral hemorrhagic fever laboratory in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou city. On 3 August, the sample tested positive for Marburg virus disease by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and negative for Ebola virus disease. The deceased patient was buried safely and with dignity on 4 August, with the support of the national Red Cross.On 5 August, the National Reference Laboratory in Conakry provided confirmation by real-time PCR of the positive Marburg result, and on 9 August, the Institut Pasteur Dakar in Senegal provided an additional confirmation that the result was positive for Marburg virus disease and negative for Ebola virus disease.The Ministry of Health activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response and engage with the community. Additionally, the Ministry of Health together with WHO, the United States Centers for Disease Control, the Alliance for International Medical Action, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the International Organization for Migration, and other partners, initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread including the implementation of contact tracing and active case search in health facilities and at the community level.During the outbreak, a total of\u00a0one\u00a0confirmed case who died, (CFR=100%) and 173 contacts were identified, including 14 high risk contacts based on exposure. Among them, 172 were followed for a period of 21 days, of which none developed symptoms. One high-risk contact was lost to follow up. At the different points of entry in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture where passengers were screened, no alerts were generated.Ongoing activities include:Marburg virus disease (MVD) is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR 24-90%). In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses, because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, particularly Ebola virus disease (EVD), as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection and plague. MVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g., monkeys and fruit bats).Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of the infection. Guinea has previous experience in managing viral hemorrhagic diseases such as EVD and Lassa fever, but this was the first time that MVD was reported. The country has a fragile health care system due to the overburden of disease outbreaks, COVID-19 pandemic, and the recurrent threat of epidemics such as malaria, yellow fever, measles, Lassa fever, EVD, health care-associated infections, high rates of acute malnutrition, cyclical natural disasters such as floods, and socio-political unrest.Guinea health authorities responded rapidly to the event, and measures were rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia increased the risk of cross-border spread. Sierra Leone and Liberia health authorities activated contingency plans and started public health measures at the points of entry with Guinea.The affected village is in a remote forest area located at the border with Sierra Leone, about 9 km from a main international border crossing point between the two countries. The proximity of the affected area to an international border, cross-border movement between the affected district and Sierra Leone, and the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and humans posed an increased risk for cross-border spread.These factors suggested a high risk at the national and regional level, and given that Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture is well connected to Foya in Liberia, and Kailahun in Sierra Leone, this outbreak required an immediate and coordinated response with support from international partners. The risk associated with the event at the global level was assessed as low.Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids of infected persons, and Marburg virus transmission associated with the provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been implemented.Health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus disease should apply standard and transmission-based IPC precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and/or bodily fluids, as well as unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. IPC precautions include:IPC assessments of health facilities in affected areas using the IPC Scorecard revealed sub-optimal results highlighting the need for ongoing supportive supervision and mentorship for implementation of IPC in health care settings in addition to implementing IPC minimum requirements to support and strengthen future preparedness for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.Integrated disease surveillance and response activities, including community-based surveillance must continue to be strengthened within all affected health zones.Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg virus disease and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include:To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmissions, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Marburg virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Guinea", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON333", "date_of_publication": "2021-08-17", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "Between 12 March and 31 July 2021\u00a0, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported four additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one associated death. The cases were reported from three regions including Riyadh (two cases), Hafar Albatin (one case), and Taif (one case). One \u00a0death was also reported from a previously reported case\u00a0 (Case #7, please see Disease outbreak news published on 14 April ) who died on 20 March.\u00a0Since 2012, Saudi Arabia has reported 2178 confirmed MERS-CoV cases with 810 deaths.The link below provides details of the four reported casesBetween September 2012 until 31 July 2021, a total of 2578 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 888 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). The majority of these cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, with one large outbreak outside this region in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, when 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings.\u00a0Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to human transmission.The notification of those additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries, or animal products (for example, consumption of \u00a0raw camel\u2019s milk), or in a healthcare setting.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacities for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources are redirected to prevent and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is working to increase the testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV infections.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures, therefore, IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted.Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, supported quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical condition such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/human-infection-with-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-\uff70-india", "date_of_publication": "2021-08-16", "headline": "Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) \uff70 India", "main_text": "On 21 July 2021, the National IHR focal point of India notified WHO of one human case of avian Influenza A(H5N1) from Haryana state, northern India. This is the first reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5N1) virus in India.The patient was a boy under 18 years of age with a recently diagnosed underlying illness in June 2021. Shortly after immunosuppressive treatment was initiated at the hospital, he presented with fever, cough, upper respiratory symptoms and breathing difficulty on 12 June. His condition progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and he was mechanically ventilated but died on 12 July. In the past year, the boy resided with a family member who owned a butchery in Haryana state. Based on initial investigations, there were no reports of poultry sickness or deaths from a nearby poultry farm in the village where he resided. The source of infection is unknown at this time and none of his family members have shown similar symptoms thus far.On 7 and 11 July 2021, respiratory samples from the patient tested positive by reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the All India Institute of Medical Science hospital for influenza A and influenza B viruses but negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. On 13 July, the samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, a WHO reference laboratory for influenza, for subtyping. Samples were tested for seasonal viruses of influenza A and influenza B, as well as avian influenza subtypes H5, H7, H9 and H10 by RT-PCR. On 15 July, the samples tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) and influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. Whole genome sequencing and virus isolation is ongoing.Local and national health authorities have taken the following monitoring, prevention and control measures:Available information and initial field investigations suggest that no additional cases have been suspected, indicating a low likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses may be reported because these viruses have been occasionally detected in poultry populations in India. The risk assessment will be reviewed as necessary, should further epidemiological or virological information become available.India has reported outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry farms every year since it was first reported in a poultry farm in Maharashtra State in February 2006. In January and February 2021, Haryana state reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in Panchkula district, which severely affected poultry in the area. In that outbreak, samples collected from birds from four poultry farms tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N8).Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.The detection of this case does not change current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.As at all times, the public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. Hand hygiene with frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended.Good food safety practices such as keeping cooking environments clean, separating raw and cooked food, and cooking food thoroughly, should also be followed. There is no evidence to suggest that influenza A(H5), A(H7N9) or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry. There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with avian influenza by consumption of eggs or egg products. However, eggs from areas with outbreaks in poultry should not be consumed raw or partially cooked (with runny yolk).Health care workers preforming aerosol-generating procedures should use airborne precautions. Standard contact and droplet precautions and appropriate personal protective equipment should be made available and used during epidemics.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza or variant viruses, a thorough epidemiologic investigation should be conducted (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) on the history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal human-to-human transmission of the novel virus. Additionally, clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Centre for further characterization.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)] and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.

Contact tracing is ongoing, along with active case searching in health facilities and at the community level. Three family members and a healthcare worker were identified as high-risk close contacts and their health is being monitored.The most recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea was declared over on 19 June 2021 and a network of community health workers was set up as part of this recent outbreak along with a WHO technical team which has remained in country to support the government\u2019s implementation of a post-EVD plan to enhance disease surveillance. This team has now been repurposed to support the government\u2019s response activities to this outbreak of Marburg.The MoH has activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response including:Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a highly virulent, epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (CFR 24-90%). In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses, because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Differential diagnoses to be excluded include, Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection, and plague. MVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).Currently, there is no specific therapeutic or drug approved for MVD. Nevertheless, supportive care including: close monitoring of vital signs, fluid resuscitation, electrolyte and acid base monitoring along with management of co-infections and organ dysfunction, are critical components of care and optimize patient outcomes and survival. Some monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are under development and other antivirals are being explored for MVD (e.g. Galidesvir, Favipiravir, Remdesivir) as part of clinical trials, but without clear results in the current moment more evidence and further studies are required. However, these should only be used as part of a randomized controlled trial.As of 7 August, only one case has been confirmed and all four identified high-risk close contacts are asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of the infection and additional contacts of the index case.Guinea has previous experience in managing recurring viral hemorrhagic diseases such as EVD and Lassa fever, but this is the first time that MVD has been reported. The country has a fragile healthcare system which is further exacerbated by multiple disease outbreaks, recurrent epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. The response activities to recent outbreaks such as EVD, COVID-19 and Lassa fever likely contributed to early detection and response to Marburg Virus Disease in Guinea.Guinea\u2019s health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being quickly implemented to control the outbreak. The affected village is in a remote forested area located near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia may increase the risk of cross-border spread and as such, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has proactively assessed the situation together with stakeholders and the district health leadership in Kono and Kailahun districts of Sierra Leone have been alerted. Health authorities in Sierra Leone and Liberia have activated contingency plans and have started public health measures at the points of entry with Guinea. Additionally the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and humans also pose an increased risk for cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at the national level, requiring an immediate and coordinated response with support from international partners. The risk at the regional level is high, based on the fact that the Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture is well connected to Liberia and Sierra Leone, although authorities are already taking action. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids of infected persons. Transmission associated with the provision of healthcare has been reported when appropriate infection control measures are not in place.Health workers should always implement standard precautions when caring for any patient, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, use of risk based personal protective equipment (PPE), safe injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection, appropriate linen and waste management, and decontamination of reusable medical equipment.Other key IPC measures to prevent healthcare associated infections include early recognition (screening, triage) along with isolation and monitoring of suspected cases, investigation of health workers exposed to Marburg cases, in-patient surveillance for Marburg cases, and safe and dignified burial practices in community settings.Health workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply additional precautionary infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s body fluids and/or contaminated surfaces. This includes the following PPE items: face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves. This further emphasizes the importance of readily available PPE at health care facilities, appropriate donning/doffing areas, IPC/WASH supplies and training on their proper uses.Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Marburg infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case searching, must be strengthened within all affected health zones. Thus, it is recommended that neighboring countries heighten their surveillance for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) in border communities and health facilities as well as strengthening community engagement on alert reporting and preventive measures.Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are important to reducing infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages to be provided to the affected communities include the following:To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes, the following advice should be communicated:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to and from Guinea.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Marburg virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Guinea", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/monkeypox---the-united-states-of-america", "date_of_publication": "2021-07-27", "headline": "Monkeypox - United States of America", "main_text": "On 17 July 2021, the IHR National Focal Point of the United States of America (USA) notified PAHO/WHO of an imported case of human monkeypox in Dallas, Texas, USA. The case-patient travelled from the USA to Lagos State, Nigeria on 25 June and also stayed in Ibadan, Oyo State, from 29 June to 3 July. He developed self-reported fever, vomiting and mild cough on 30 June, and a painful genital rash on 7 July. The case-patient returned to the USA, departing Lagos on 8 July and arriving on 9 July. He developed a facial rash on the next day. On 13 July, the patient attended a local hospital; fever was documented, and he was immediately placed under isolation.Sample of a skin lesion was taken, and on 14 July, an Orthopoxvirus was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by Dallas County. On 15 July, the patient\u2019s skin samples tested positive for the West African clade of monkeypoxvirus via RT-PCR conducted at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) Poxvirus and Rabies Branch Laboratory. The patient is currently hospitalized.At this time, the source of infection for this case is unknown. Although monkeypox is considered a zoonotic disease, the wildlife reservoir has not been determined. During an outbreak of monkeypox in human in 2003 in the USA, exposure was traced to contact with pet prairie dogs that had been co-housed with monkeypoxvirus-infected African rodents, imported from Ghana. Contact with wild animals (including live animals, meat for consumption, and other products) are known potential risk factors in enzootic countries. Prolonged contact with an infected person can also result in person-to-person transmission.An outbreak occurred in Nigeria from 2017 to 2019, with cases still being reported in 2021. In addition to Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in nine other countries in central and western Africa since 1970. In 2020, over 6200 suspected cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sporadic outbreaks among humans have occurred in other countries such as Cameroon or the Central African Republic.This is the first time that human monkeypox has been detected in a traveller to the USA, and the first case reported in the USA since the outbreak in 2003. Human monkeypox in travellers from Nigeria has been documented on seven previous occasions since 1978. The earliest documented travel-related case occurred in Benin in a patient who had contracted the infection in Oyo State, Nigeria. Since 2018, six cases have been reported and confirmed in non-endemic countries via travelers to Israel (2018), Singapore (2019), and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (two cases in 2018, one in 2019 and one in 2021). Lagos State and Oyo State in Nigeria continue to report and confirm sporadic cases. Additionally, cases have been reported in South Sudan which were likely imported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Public health measures are being taken, including isolation and treatment of the patient. The US CDC and state and local health departments are monitoring possible community and health care contacts who, during the infectious periods, had contact with the case-patient. The US CDC is working with the airline and state and local health officials to contact airline passengers who shared a common seating area with the patient during his travel from Nigeria and within the USA.Travellers on these flights were required to wear masks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on the flights is therefore considered low, contamination of common use areas such as toilets may have occurred. Health personnel involved in the patient\u2019s care have been wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Post-exposure vaccination with a smallpox vaccine within 14 days from the most recent contact with the case-patient may be recommended for some contacts. As of 25 July, over 200 persons are being monitored in the USA and none have developed symptoms consistent with monkeypox.The surveillance and public health response in Nigeria for the re-emergence of monkeypox since 2017 is ongoing across the country. Outbreak investigation related to this case is focused on Lagos and Oyo States and involves human and animal health specialists to identify possible sources of exposure and monitor persons who may have been in contact with the reported case.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family. Genomic sequencing shows there are two monkeypox clades \u2013 Congo Basin and West African \u2013 consistent with observed differences in human pathogenicity and fatality in the two geographic areas. Both clades can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets, or via fomites such as bedding, and can be fatal in humans.The incubation period for monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days.\u00a0 The disease is often self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14-21 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be painful and become itchy. Although the West African clade of monkeypox virus infection generally causes mild disease, it may lead to severe illness in some individuals. The case fatality rate for the West African clade is around 1% while it may be as high as 10% for the Congo Basin clade. Immune deficiency appears to be a risk factors for severe disease. Children are also at higher risk and monkeypox during pregnancy may lead to complications, congenital monkeypox or stillbirth.Milder cases of monkeypox may go undetected and represent a risk of person-to-person transmission. There is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those travelling and exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to parts of West and Central Africa.While a vaccine has been approved for prevention of monkeypox, and traditional smallpox vaccine also provides protection, these vaccines are not widely available and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes.\u00a0 Increased susceptibility to monkeypox is in part related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization.The animal reservoir remains unknown, although is likely to be among small mammals. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection.Any illness during travel in an endemic area or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travellers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat). The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.Patient care for monkeypox is symptom-based optimal care. A patient with monkeypox should be provided with supportive care and treatment of underlying conditions and complications. In some circumstances, specific antiviral treatment approved for smallpox may be offered on a compassionate or emergency use basis.A patient with monkeypox should be isolated during the infectious period, just prior to and including the rash stage of the infection until all lesions have crusted and fallen off. Timely contact-tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of emerging diseases among health care providers are essential to effectively manage monkeypox outbreaks and prevent secondary cases.Health workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. This includes all workers such as cleaners and laundry personnel who may be exposed to the patient care setting, bedding, towels, or personal belongings. \u00a0Samples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to, or trade with, Nigeria or the USA based on available information at this time.WHO health topics page on monkeypox (Updated July 2021).WHO factsheet on monkeypox, 9 December 2019WHO monkeypox outbreak tool kit WHO disease outbreak news, monkeypox, all. 1997 \u2013 2020 Weekly epidemiological record (WER) no.11, 16 March 2018, Emergence of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa 1970-2017Monkeypox: Introduction.

The case developed a vesicular rash on 13 June 2021. Swabs of the lesions were received for diagnostic confirmation on 14 June and orthopoxvirus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 15 June 2021.This case is a family member of the two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom in May 2021. All three cases were admitted to a specialist infectious diseases unit. They have now fully recovered and been discharged from hospital.The health authorities identified 30 close contacts of the cases and all have completed 21 days of active monitoring from their last date of exposure. No transmission outside the family has been identified.The health care workers caring for the three cases within the specialist infectious diseases unit have been vaccinated.Information about these three cases was shared with the Nigerian National IHR Focal Point who continue to gather further information regarding potential sources of infection and exposure in Nigeria.

The case fatality ratio for the West African clade has been documented to be around 1%, whereas for the Congo Basin clade, it may be as high as 10%.To date, in the United Kingdom, there have been only seven cases of monkeypox reported, these three cases, three previously imported cases from Nigeria \u2013 two in September 2018 and one in December 2019 and one case of nosocomial transmission in a health care worker in England in 2018 due to contact with contaminated bed linen.As mentioned above, the third confirmed case is an extended close contact of the previous two cases and all cases are from the same household and have fully recovered. No additional contacts have been identified linked to this new case. None of the close contacts have travelled outside the United Kingdom following exposure. Therefore, this case does not change the public health risk in the country and the chance of further disease spread remains low. The possible source of exposure and risk of further spread in Nigeria is being assessed.For background information on monkeypox outbreaks in Nigeria, kindly see the DON published previously on 11 June 2021.Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history.

This was the first Ebola outbreak in Guinea since the large outbreak that affected West Africa in 2014-2016. This recent outbreak was announced on 14 February 2021 following the identification of a cluster of seven suspected Ebola cases in Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9 and Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 City sub-prefectures in N\u2019z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 prefecture.

In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to survivor\u2019s body fluids have been documented in previous outbreaks. Investigations into the source of this outbreak using genomic sequencing, \u00a0demonstrated that the identified 2021 virus lineage was very closely related to a virus circulating in Guinea in 2014. However, the index case in this outbreak was not a known survivor of the 2014-2016 outbreak. They were however a health worker who is known to be at an increased risk of contracting EVD when infection prevention and control measures are not fully practiced as was likely in this situation. In-depth epidemiological investigations into the source of this outbreak have not drawn conclusive hypotheses to date, as to where and how the index case was infected. Thus, Investigations remain ongoing and a risk of additional undetected cases remains. A functioning surveillance system is key to detect cases of EVD however throughout this outbreak the surveillance system met several challenges. For example, only nine (39%) of the 23 cases were known contacts at the time of detection indicating that case investigation and contact listing was not comprehensive. Additionally, the alert system reported a suboptimal numbers of alerts and faced difficulties to investigate and test suspect cases of EVD. Neighboring prefectures of Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 also reported few alerts, even fewer of which were validated and tested demonstrating the challenges faced with surveillance in these remote hard-to-reach areas. Therefore, although 42 days after the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time the outbreak has been declared over (as per WHO recommendations) there remains a possibility that there are unrecognized chains of transmission in the community.WHO considers that ongoing challenges of access and epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and a recent yellow fever outbreak, might challenge the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to a new EVD outbreak.Detection of EVD cases is not unexpected in Guinea given that the virus is enzootic in some animal populations in the country and can persist in certain body fluids of survivors.

WHO does not recommend the isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus. There also is a need to maintain collaborative relationships with survivors, survivor associations, their families, and their communities while monitoring individuals health to prevent further stigmatization.Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Guinea.Ebola virus disease fact sheetOptimized Supportive Care for Ebola Virus Disease.

Prior to travel, the patient had lived and worked in Delta State, Nigeria.On arrival in the United Kingdom, the patient remained in quarantine with family due to COVID-19 restrictions. On 10\u00a0May, the patient developed a rash, beginning on the face. The patient remained in self-isolation for a further ten days and sought medical care for relief of symptoms. The patient was admitted to a referral hospital on 23 May. Skin lesion samples were received at the Public Health England Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory on 24 May. The West African clade of monkeypox virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 25 May.On 29 May, a family member with whom the patient quarantined developed lesions clinically compatible with monkeypox and was immediately isolated in an appropriate facility. Monkeypox was confirmed on 31 May. Both patients are stable and recovering.The health authorities of the United Kingdom activated an incident management team and implemented public health measures, including isolation of the index case and secondary case and contact tracing of all close contacts in the hospital and community.Follow up is being undertaken for the contacts of the two cases for 21 days after their last exposure. No close contacts have travelled outside the United Kingdom following exposure. Post-exposure vaccination was not offered to contacts.Information was shared with the Nigerian National IHR Focal Point who have initiated an outbreak investigation and are gathering further information regarding potential source of infection and exposures in Nigeria.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa.

Symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be very itchy or painful. Milder cases of monkeypox may go unreported and represent a risk of person-to-person transmission. The animal reservoir remains unknown, although is likely to be among rodents. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are known risk factors.There are two clades of monkeypox virus, the West African clade and Congo Basin (Central African) clade. Although the West African clade of monkeypox virus infection sometimes leads to severe illness in some individuals, disease is usually self-limiting. The case fatality ratio for the West African clade has been documented to be around 1% whereas for the Congo Basin clade it may be as high as 10%.Currently in the United Kingdom, including these two cases, there have been only six cases of monkeypox reported, including three previously imported cases from Nigeria, two in September 2018 and one in December 2019. Prior to this report, there was also one case of nosocomial transmission in a health worker in England in 2018 due to contact with contaminated bed linen. In the present case, the first patient was under quarantine with family members due to COVID-19 restrictions for a period of ten days after arrival in the country and an additional two days. Contacts possibly exposed are being monitored.\u00a0 Once monkeypox was suspected, authorities in the United Kingdom promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the case and contact tracing. The second individual was isolating at home until onset of the rash and in hospital care thereafter. The risk of potential onward spread in the country is minimized.In 2017, Nigeria began to experience its first outbreak in 40 years. From the first cases in September 2017 to November 2019, a total of 183 confirmed cases and 9 deaths were recorded in\u00a0\u00a0 18 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Imo, Akwa\u00a0 Ibom, Lagos, Delta, Bauchi, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abia, Oyo, Enugu, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Edo, Anambra). The outbreak occurred primarily in southern parts of the country including Delta State. Public health measures included enhanced surveillance and health worker training, as well as isolation of cases, contact-tracing and quarantine. Since then, sporadic cases have continued to occur in Nigeria pointing to endemicity of the disease. In 2020, there were 14 suspected cases, three confirmed cases and no deaths. In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported from January and May. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from five states Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1) and no deaths were recorded.While a vaccine was approved for monkeypox in 2019, and traditional smallpox vaccine provides cross-protection for monkeypox, these vaccines are not widely available. There is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to West and Central Africa. Increased susceptibility of humans to monkeypox is thought to be related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization. Populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes.Importations of monkeypox from an endemic country to another country not previously known to have cases have been documented on a total of eight, once in 2003 and the rest since 2018.The public health risk from this reported event is low in the United Kingdom. Monkeypox remains endemic in parts of West and Central Africa and represents an ongoing risk for further local outbreaks and travel-related cases. On this occasion, the confirmed index case has a history of travel from Delta State in Nigeria, where monkeypox has previously been reported. An investigation is underway in Delta State.Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. Residents and travelers to endemic countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat). The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized.A patient with monkeypox should be isolated during the infectious period, that is during the rash stage of the illness, and contacts should be observed in quarantine. Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential parts of preventing secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO factsheet on monkeypox, 9 December 2019WHO monkeypox outbreak tool kitWHO disease outbreak news, monkeypox, Nigeria, 21 December 2017; 5 October 2018WHO disease outbreak news, monkeypox, all. 1997 \u2013 2020Weekly epidemiological record (WER) no.11, 16 March 2018, Emergence of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa 1970-2017Monkeypox: Introduction.

This is the first case of human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) virus reported globally. The case is a 41-year-old male from Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province. He developed fever and nausea on 23 April 2021 and was admitted to the intensive care unit of a local hospital on 28 April 2021. The case is currently in a stable condition. The National Influenza Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, completed genetic sequencing and analysis of the specimen and confirmed the detection of an influenza A(H10N3) virus of avian origin.The case had no clear history of exposure to poultry prior to illness onset, based on epidemiological investigation. No avian influenza A(H10N3) virus has been found in the local surroundings or poultry. Close contacts of the case have not shown any symptoms. Based on the local and national assessment, the case was considered to be an incidental infection from avian to human transmission, with a low likelihood of human-to-human transmission.The Chinese government has taken the following monitoring, prevention and control measures:This is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) to be detected. Previously, Australia and Egypt detected human infections with influenza A(H10N7), and China reported three human infections with avian influenza A(H10N8) in late 2013 and early 2014. Targeted surveillance projects have detected avian influenza A(H10N3) viruses in birds, however the extent of circulation and epidemiology of this virus in birds is unclear. Further genetic and antigenic characterization are ongoing to determine if this virus is different from previously detected avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses.Most previously reported human infections with avian influenza viruses were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Since avian influenza viruses, including A(H10Nx) viruses, continue to be detected in poultry populations, further sporadic human cases could be detected in the future. Currently available epidemiologic information suggests that avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission, thus the likelihood of spread among humans is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely. The risk assessment will be reviewed as necessary, should further epidemiological or virological information become available.The detection of this case does not change current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. The public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces. Hand hygiene with frequent washing or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended. WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this event based on the currently available information.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.

The declaration was made in accordance with\u00a0WHO recommendations, 42 days after the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time on 21 March 2021.The outbreak was declared on 7 February 2021 after a resident in Mwenye/Makumo in Masoya Health Area in Biena HZ tested positive for EVD. To date, the source of infection of the initial case in this outbreak is yet to be determined. Overall, 12 cases were reported (11 confirmed and 1 probable). Of these 12 cases, eight (73%) were known and followed contacts at time of detection, and all were linked epidemiologically within a unique chain of transmission. All 12 EVD cases were reported in four health zones of North Kivu Province with onset of symptoms reported between 25 January and 26 February 2021. Of these cases, six died and six recovered after receiving appropriate treatment. Two of the 12 cases were health workers who contracted the infection while caring for the initial case in this outbreak, both survived. The last confirmed cases were reported on 1 March 2021, all among family members of a confirmed cases.This was the 12th EVD outbreak reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the virus was first identified in 1976, and the second in North Kivu Province.During the outbreak, from 7 February to 3 May 2021, case investigations into all confirmed and probable cases identified 1 194 contacts in 48 health areas of five health zones. To date, all contacts have completed their 21 day follow up period. A dedicated team continued to search for contacts who were lost to follow up, never seen or displaced during the 42 days since the last exposure to a confirmed EVD case to ensure that transmission chains were not missed. Over the course of the outbreak, 33 229 alerts were reported from 17 health zones of the Butembo and Beni division of the provincial department of Health. Additionally, over 1.5 million travellers were screened at points of entry of DRC, and nearly 2 000 individuals were vaccinated against EVD.The Public Health response was coordinated by the Provincial Department of Health, Butembo division in collaboration with WHO.In response to this EVD outbreak, from 7 February 2021 to 3 May 2021:On 3 May 2021, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of human-to-human transmission of EVD over in North Kivu Province considering that more than 42 days (two maximum incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of the second consecutive negative test of the last confirmed case. The World Health Organization assess that the surveillance system in place has proven its capacity to detect cases. The Ministry of Health drafted a 90-day plan which includes the strengthening and consolidation of public health surveillance systems.WHO notes \u00a0that there remains a risk of re-emergence of EVD.\u00a0 Ebola virus is enzootic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months which, in rare events, may result in secondary transmission. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major\u00a0outbreak. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are still gaps in the country\u2019s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.Since 10 March 2020, when the first confirmed COVID-19 case was registered in DRC a total of 29 962 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 766 deaths have been reported nationwide as of 1st May 2021.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission in humans:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON317", "date_of_publication": "2021-04-14", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "Between 1 January 2021 and 11 March 2021, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported seven additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection, including three associated deaths. Additional death was reported from a previously reported case (Case #2, please see Disease outbreak news published on 1 February 2021). The cases were reported from Riyadh (four cases), Jeddah (one case), Al-Ahsaa (one case), Makkah (one case) regions.The link below provides details of the seven reported casesSince 2012 until 11 March 2021, a total of 2574 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 886 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health regulations (IHR 2005). The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacity for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources have been redirected towards SARS-CoV-2. \u00a0The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is working to increase the testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV infections.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted.Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, supported quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures and clear and consistent risk communication can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-global-update", "date_of_publication": "2021-03-26", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 \u2013 Global update", "main_text": "A global update on circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks and events is summarized below, as of February 2021.In 2020, 959 human cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and 411 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported globally from 27 countries, of which 21 countries were from the African Region and six countries from reported from the regions of the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe and the Western Pacific. The number of cVDPV cases and environmental samples increased in 2020 compared to 2019 when 366 cVDPV2 cases and 173 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported.The latest epidemiological information on circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus is updated on a weekly basis.Since 2017, several genetically-distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks continue to be reported across the Region. In total, 21 countries are affected by ongoing cVDPV2, and outbreak response activities continue to be implemented in\u00a0Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Togo.Afghanistan has reported co-circulation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and cVDPV2. In 2020, 56 WPV1 cases and 35 environmental samples positive for WPV 1 were reported; 307 cases of cVDPV2 and 172 environmental samples positive for cVDVP2 were reported. Of the 307 cVDPV2 cases reported in acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in 2020, 199 (65%) genetically derived from the Pakistan- Gilgit-Baltistan -1 emergence which originated in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. The remaining 108 cases were classified as a new emergence from Afghanistan; 105 cases were classified as AFG-NGR-1 and 3 as AFG-HLD-1. As of February 2021, 11 cVDPV2 cases and nine environmental samples positive for cVDVP2 were reported in 2021.Pakistan is one of the two endemic countries for polio, and has reported co-circulation of WPV1 and cVDPV2. In 2020, 84 WPV1 cases and 407 environmental samples positive for WPV1 were reported. Among the 84 WPV1 cases, 60 were reported in the first half of 2020 while the remaining 24 cases were reported in the second half (compared to 103 cases during the same period in 2019). As of 28 February 2021, Pakistan has reported one case of WPV1 in 2021.In 2020, 135 cVDPV2 cases and 135 environmental samples positive for cVDPV2 were reported from Pakistan. Since the beginning of 2021, there have been six cVDPV2 cases and ten cVDPV2 positive environmental samples reported to date. The cVDPV2 outbreak poses increased risk of spread to neighboring countries, and cVDPV2 has been detected from Iran and Tajikistan.Sudan continues to report a cVDPV2 outbreak, which originated in Chad, with 57 cases reported in 2020.Somalia\u00a0continues to report a cVDPV2 outbreak, with three cVDPV2 cases in 2019 and 14 cVDPV2 cases in 2020.\u00a0 In 2021, cVDPV2 linked to Somalia was detected in Kenya.In Tajikistan, the first cVDPV2 case with onset of AFP on 22 November 2020 was reported from Khatlon province. cVDPV2 detected from this case was linked to cVDPV2 currently circulating in Pakistan. In February 2020, cVDPV2 was identified in another AFP case in Khatlon province, as well as in a healthy child from Vahdat district close to the capital, Dushanbe.On 8 March 2021, two more AFP cases with cVDPV2 were confirmed in Hisor district. Three environmental samples from the newly established surveillance site in Dushanbe were reported cVDPV2 positive.In the Philippines, outbreak response to a cVDPV2 outbreak, which emerged in 2019, is continuing.\u00a0 A total of 13 cases have been associated with this outbreak in the country; 12 in 2019 and one in 2020. No cVDPV2 cases have been reported since January 2020.\u00a0 However, after the use of type 2 monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) in large-scale polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), one case of ambiguous vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (aVDPV2) was detected in 2020. Separately, the country is also affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak, with two cases reported in the country in 2019. No cVDPV1 cases have been reported since December 2019.The cVDPV2 outbreak response in Malaysia is also continuing. No cases of cVDPV2 have been reported since March 2020 while several environmental samples tested positive for cVDPV2. All of them were genetically linked with cVDPV2 in the Philippines. Malaysia is also affected by the cVDPV1 outbreak and the response is ongoing. Four cases have been associated with this outbreak in the country, three in 2019 and one in 2020. All cases were genetically linked with the cases detected in the Philippines. No cases of cVDPV1 have been detected since March 2020.According to the WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) coverage was estimated to be 41% and 99% in Philippines and Malaysia respectively in 2019.In 2019 and early 2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) developed the Strategy for the Response to type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2020\u20132021 to more effectively address the evolving cVDPV2 epidemiology, including as appropriate through the roll-out of an improved vaccine, novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), through the WHO Emergency Use Listing.\u00a0 This strategy is in line with Executive Board Decision from 7 February 2020, which also called for the mobilization of domestic financial resources to complement international financial and political commitments, to address the evolving cVDPV2 emergency.African Region: The African Region completed assessments of existing outbreaks and based on the findings and recommendations, and in accordance with global guidelines, this led to the closure of 18 genetically-distinct outbreaks in 2020 in six countries: Angola, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zambia. Countries across the region are continuing to implement response in line with international outbreak response guidelines, supported by the Regional Rapid Response Team.Eastern Mediterranean Region: The regional Incident Management Support Team (IMST), jointly coordinated by WHO and UNICEF, is supporting countries in their outbreak response and field investigation efforts. To ensure greater engagement of government leadership and provide additional support to both affected countries in the Region, WHO established the Ministerial Regional Subcommittee on Polio Eradication and Outbreaks, which is planned to convene in mid-March 2021.The national Polio eradication programme in Pakistan is determined to interrupt the circulation of cVDPV2 by June 2021 and WPV1 by June 2022 as a key component of the broader health and economic COVID-19 recovery process.European Region: In Tajikistan, local health authorities are preparing to fast-track response with nOPV2 campaigns. According to the WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates, IPV coverage was estimated to be 96% in 2019.African Region: WHO considers there to be very high risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 due to the low population immunity against poliovirus type 2 (PV2) and low IPV vaccination coverage. This in conjunction with the existence of known viruses that have persisted for over one year, large-scale population movements, and ongoing challenges for country\u2019s public health systems due to the COVID-19 epidemic and other infectious disease outbreaks in the Region.Eastern Mediterranean Region: WHO considers there to be a high risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2, based on existence of known polioviruses that have persisted in the population/environment for over one year, large inaccessible populations in some countries, where large pockets of low population immunity arise as a result.European Region: WHO considers there to be a low to moderate risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 in the Region.Western Pacific Region: WHO considers there to be a low to moderate risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2.In all instances, the continued spread of existing outbreaks as well as the emergence of new outbreaks of cVDPV2 point to gaps in routine immunization coverage in addition to insufficient reactive vaccination as an outbreak response, with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). The risk of further spread of such strains, or the emergence of new strains in 2021 is magnified by an increasing gap in global mucosal-immunity to type 2 poliovirus and dropping immunization rates related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.In its report from its most recent meeting in February 2021, the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) on the international spread of poliovirus expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2, and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently very high and urged the implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk.It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations.\u00a0To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict at the point of departure travel of individuals, who have not been vaccinated or cannot prove the vaccination status.As of 26 March 2021, updates on polioviruses will no longer be published on the Disease Outbreak News website. Instead, a Disease Outbreak News will serve as an alert when a change in polio the epidemiological situation worldwide is noted by GPEI,\u00a0who closely monitor the situation on a weekly basis.

He developed fever and cough on 18 January and visited a private hospital several times with no improvement. \u00a0The condition of the case worsened, and on 24 January, a chest X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. On 26 January, he was admitted to a private hospital and was transferred to a governmental hospital on 28 January. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 31 January and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 1 February at the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory in Abu Dhabi. He has no underlying conditions. SARS-CoV-2\u00a0testing was performed more than once, and it was negative. No history of previous infection or\u00a0exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was reported. The case reported a history of close contact with dromedary camels at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. No travel history was reported during the same period. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.The first MERS-CoV case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported in July 2013. Since then, a total of 92 cases of MERS-CoV (including the above case) and 12 associated deaths have been reported in the United Arab Emirates. At a global level,\u00a0from 2012 until 2 February 2021, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2567 with 882 associated deaths. Most of the cases have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with the affected Member States.In UAE, the surveillance for MERS-CoV during the COVID-19 pandemic mandate testing for all cases meeting severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) definition.Upon identification, an incident report, case investigation, and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation included screening of all close contacts at household and healthcare facilities. All identified contacts of the confirmed case were monitored on a daily basis for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed case. All of them have completed the 14-day monitoring period and no further cases were reported. Additionally, all close contacts of the patients have been tested for MERS-CoV and so far all are negative.The veterinary authorities have been notified and investigation in animals is ongoing.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacity for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources have been redirected towards SARS-CoV-2. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON313", "date_of_publication": "2021-02-26", "headline": "Human infection with avian influenza A (H5N8) - Russian Federation", "main_text": "On 18 February 2021, the National IHR Focal Point for the Russian Federation notified WHO of detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) in seven human clinical specimens. These are the first reported detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) in humans. Positive clinical specimens were collected from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the seven specimens were performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The age of seven positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years and five were female.Between 3 and 11 December, a total of 101 000 of 900 000 egg laying hens on the farm died. This high mortality rate prompted an investigation. Samples were collected from these birds and an initial detection of avian influenza A(H5N8) was performed by the Russian regional veterinary laboratory. On 11 December, the outbreak was confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference laboratory, and the Federal Centre for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH), in Vladimir, the Russian Federation. Outbreak containment operations started immediately and continued for several days due to the large size of the poultry farm.In addition to operations on the farm, acute and convalescent sera was collected from the seven positive human cases for serological testing. The results were suggestive of recent infection.The cases remained asymptomatic for the whole follow-up duration (several weeks). Follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during medical observation period and were tested negative for avian influenza A(H5N8). No obvious clinical manifestations were reported from any farm workers under medical surveillance, their family members, or other close contacts of the seven cases.Influenza A(H5N8) viruses isolated from this poultry outbreak in Astrakhan belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses. In 2020, avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses were also detected in poultry or wild birds in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation.On receiving the initial signal of a probable outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at the poultry farm on 3 December 2020, the national authorities took immediate measures including cessation of poultry production cycles, and product transportation from the affected farm.Between 11 and 18 December, several measures including culling and disposing of poultry, eggs, litter and disinfection of contaminated premises were taken as part of outbreak response activitiesDuring and after the culling of all the poultry, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples were collected from poultry farm workers and personnel involved in outbreak response at the farm. The surveillance activities, both within and outside of the containment area, was intensified. A total of 24 close contacts of the confirmed cases have been identified and traced. In total, 150 individuals were monitored for clinical indication of respiratory disease and received antiviral prophylaxis therapy. No symptoms were reported among these individuals.Whole Genome Sequencing of avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses isolated from poultry and from one of the seven human cases was performed and were uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database on 20 February 2021. Genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus is ongoing.WHO is following up with the public health authorities in the Russian Federation, including implementation of public health measures warranted by such events, and with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) on further analysis and assessment of the virus materials and serum samples. On 20 February, a special briefing by the head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing was organized for the state Russian media to inform the public about these cases and the implications.Since 2004, avian influenza A(H5) viruses have spread from Asia to Europe via wild birds. The genetic clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have often reassorted among other avian influenza viruses, resulting in avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N5), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, some of which have been detected in birds in many countries .In the Russian Federation, avian influenza A(H5N8) of clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated for the first time in 2014 in a wild bird in the northern region of Russian Far East.As mentioned earlier, all the seven cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.Further genetic and antigenic characterization and information on seroconversion among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.The development of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines, coordinated by WHO, remains an essential component of the overall global strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.Based on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.These cases do not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza, which should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, litter and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves, and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) . People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for seven days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see\u00a0case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR\u00a0). Evidence of illness is not required.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.Based on the currently available information, WHO advises against any special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions on travel and/or trade with the Russian Federation.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Human infection with avian influenza A (H5N8)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Russian Federation", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON312", "date_of_publication": "2021-02-17", "headline": "Ebola - Guinea", "main_text": "On 14 February 2021, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Guinea informed WHO of a cluster of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases in the sub-prefecture of Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 Region, Guinea between 18 January and 13 February 2021.\u00a0The cases showed symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of another relative (a 51 year-old nurse) on 1 February 2021.The index case of the cluster was a nurse who had originally presented at a health centre in Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9 on 18 January 2021 with headache, physical weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever. She was diagnosed with typhoid. She sought a second consultation at a health facility in Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 on 23 January 2021 for fever, vomiting, liquid stools, and physical weakness, and she was diagnosed with malaria. On 24 January she consulted a traditional practitioner in Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, and she died on 28 January 2021. She was buried unsafely on 1 February in Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9. The other six cases are the five family members and the traditional practitioner she visited.Among the seven cases, five have died (4 probable and 1 confirmed). The other two confirmed cases are currently in isolation in dedicated health care facilities in Conakry and Gou\u00e9ck\u00e9, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 region.The Ebolavirus species is not yet determined. Additional laboratory analyses are on-going to ascertain virus species.As of 15 February, one hundred and ninety-two (192) contacts have been identified, including 164 contacts in N\u2019Z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 Health District and 28 in Ratoma Health District, Conakry. To date, no contacts have been reported to have travelled in neighboring countries. However, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 is the second-largest city in Guinea and lies at the intersection of roads from Ganta (in Liberia), Danan\u00e9 (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), and roads to other major hubs in Guinea like Kankan and Macenta in (Guinea). Therefore, there is concern about the exportation of EVD cases into the neighboring countries.On 14 February 2021, following the declaration of the EVD outbreak, the MoH of Guinea convened a crisis meeting.The MoH , WHO, Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners, have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. To coordinate the response, the MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees. They also advised the public to take measures to avert the spread of the disease, and to report any persons with symptoms to seek care. Multidisciplinary teams have been deployed to the field to; actively search and provide care for cases, trace and follow-up contacts, and sensitize communities on infection prevention and control. Planned and in-progress response measures include the following:WHO support for the Guinean authoritiesWHO considers the risk of spread in the country as very high given the unknown size, duration and origin of the outbreak; potentially large number of contacts; potential spread to other parts of Guinea and neighboring countries; limited response capacity currently on the ground; and unknown virus strain. In addition, there are ongoing challenges for the public health system due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and recent yellow fever and measles outbreaks.WHO assess the risk for the region as high. The Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 Region of Guinea shares borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, where EVD outbreaks occurred previously. Despite some movement restrictions across official border-crossings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cross-border movement continues to take place and poses a risk of EVD spread. It is therefore essential that neighboring countries assess their preparedness capacities and implement readiness/response measures.The countries in the region should:WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission:Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Guinea.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Guinea", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON311", "date_of_publication": "2021-02-12", "headline": "Rift valley fever - Kenya", "main_text": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been reported in Kenya in humans in Isiolo and Mandera counties and in animals in Isiolo, Mandera, Murang\u2019a and Garissa counties. As of 4 February 2021, there were a total of 32 human cases (14 confirmed positive), and 11 deaths (CFR 34 %).Isiolo CountyThe event is believed to have started on 19 November 2020, with deaths among herders presenting with symptoms of fever, headache, general malaise with or without nausea, epistaxis/hematemesis, and abdominal pain/diarrhoea reported to the County Department of Health in Isiolo. The first human case was reported in late November 2020 from Sericho ward in Garbatulla Subcounty. Deaths have been reported in Gafarsa and Erisaboru within Garbatulla subcounty as well Korbesa in Merti subcounty. On 16 December, RVF was confirmed by PCR at the National Virology Laboratory (NVL), Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). As of 4 February 2021, a total of 22 human cases had been reported (12 confirmed positive), and 10 deaths (three confirmed positive). Most cases were from Garbatulla subcounty, with the majority being herders, male, and aged 13 to 70 years old.Sheep and goats were also reported sick on 19 November 2020 in Sericho subcounty, which is mainly pastoral. The communities in this area live in villages and livestock are grazed in communal grazing areas. Animal samples tested IgM and real time PCR positive for RVF at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), Kabete and the Regional Veterinary Investigation Laboratory in Garissa. The event was officially confirmed on 7 January 2021 and reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 15 January 2021 and later on 22 and 29 January 2021. As of 27 January, a total of 20 livestock samples (19 sheep and 1 camel) had tested positive for RVF by IgM-capture ELISA and real-time PCR.Mandera CountyA patient from Kalmalab village, Mandera North subcounty fell ill after he was involved in the slaughter of four sick camels. He was evacuated to a Nairobi hospital with haemorrhagic symptoms on 18 January. He was later admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with multiple organ failure. RVF was confirmed on 21 January at the NVL. He died on 22 January 2021. As of 4 February 2021, a total of 10 cases (2 confirmed RVF positive), including 1 death had been reported from Mandera North sub county.Kalmalab village borders the river Dawa which broke its banks following rains in the Ethiopian highlands. The RVF outbreak may be associated with this flooding, as it increases the risk of mosquito-borne zoonosis. Livestock samples have been submitted to CVL Kabete for testing.Murang\u2019a CountyLivestock with RVF syndromes (including bleeding and abortions) were first reported on 29 December 2020 in Gatanga subcounty, Kihumbuini ward. The first animal death was reported on 1 January 2021. Samples were collected from the same farm on 1 January and were confirmed RVF positive on 3 January at CVL Kabete using Elisa IgG/IgM testing. More suspected animal cases have been reported in Ng\u2019araria ward in Kandara subcounty. No human cases have been confirmed, however suspected cases were traced and samples from affected households were collected on 25 January for testing at NVL.Garissa CountySamples from suspected livestock (sheep and goats) were collected from Masalani, Ijara Subcounty and Balambala, Balambala Subcountrym on 20 December 2020 for testing and were confirmed positive for RVF on 22 December using Elisa IgM testing. Field investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of the outbreak.Surveillance in livestock was initiated after the detection of the RVF outbreak in Isiolo. Outbreaks among animals were observed during this time period. In December 2020, results from CVL Kabete taken from 120 livestock revealed 20 (19 sheep out of which 10 died, and 1 camel) positive RVF cases confirmed by Elisa IgM testing. Further laboratory analysis are ongoing in both human and livestock samples.WHO is working closely with the Ministry of Health via the local health cluster alongside the FAO and OIE in supporting the following public health activities in response to the outbreak:RVF outbreaks are recurrent in Kenya and there have been several RVF outbreaks in the past (1998, 2006-2007, 2014, 2018). The current outbreak affecting humans and animals in Isiolo (Ewaso Nyiro), Mandera (Dawa) and Garissa counties is associated with rivers flooding. There was no flooding/rainfall in Muranga; outbreaks are around swampy areas, and quarry lakes. Contact with infected animals was associated with human infection. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Isiolo and Garissa counties are pastoral communities (primarily sheep and goats) where livestock are grazed in communal grazing areas.The onset of the event began in Sericho, Isiolo county around 19 November 2020. RVF outbreaks were later reported in Balambala and Ijara Subcounties, Garissa county on 7 December 2020 that were attributed to flooding along the Ewaso Basin whose river burst its banks in early November 2020. This then led livestock to migrate and graze along the marshy areas of the nearby riverbank. The location of the event is currently reported in four counties within Kenya. Yet, given the favourable environmental conditions (heavy rainfall and flooding) that can increase the presence of disease vectors, along with uncontrolled movement of viraemic animals (in search of water and pasture), there is an increased risk of disease spreading to other parts within Kenya and to neighbouring countries. It should be highlighted that an RVF outbreak will have a severe economic impact on this pastoral community that is dependent on livestock production. The last animal vaccination for RVF was in 2018, but the exact coverage is unknown. Although the country has local capacity, response measures remain insufficient. Vector control measures have not been conducted and a national vector control plan has yet to be developed.The first confirmed COVID-19 case was registered in Kenya on 12 March 2020. As of 8 February 2021, Kenya had reported 101 819 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,779 deaths.. The impact of the pandemic has led to a wide-spread shortage of supplies necessary to mount an effective RVF response such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Furthermore, surveillance officers and laboratory services have largely prioritised the COVID-19 response.Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne zoonosis primarily affecting domestic animals (such as sheep, goats, and camels). Humans get infected through contact with viraemic animals and their fluids (blood, etc.). Human cases often occur in proximity to outbreaks in livestock in an environment favourable for mosquito vectors that also transmit the virus to animals and sometimes to humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, bodily fluids or tissues of infected animals. Awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection, integrated vector control activities and protective measures against mosquito bites is essential in reducing human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Kenya or the affected area based on the current information available on this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Kenya", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON310", "date_of_publication": "2021-02-10", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "On 7 February 2021, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after the laboratory confirmation of one case in North Kivu Province. The case was an adult female living in Biena Health Zone. To date the source of infection is still under investigation.On 25 January 2021, the case presented with nasal bleeding. From 25 January to 1 February, she reportedly received outpatient care at a local health centre. From 1 to 3 February, she was admitted to a second health centre with signs of physical weakness, dizziness, joint pain, epigastric pain, liquid stools, headache and difficulty breathing. On 3 February, a blood sample was collected for EVD testing due to her epidemiological link with an EVD survivor. On the same day, she was referred to a hospital in Katwa Health Zone (part of Butembo city) following the deterioration of her condition. She was admitted to the intensive care unit the same day and died on 4 February. On 5 February, the body was buried in Musienene Health Zone, however not under safe burial practices.On 6 February, Butembo laboratory confirmed the case positive for EVD by GeneXpert. On 7 February, the sample was shipped to Goma laboratory, and tested positive for EVD by GeneXpert on 8 February. Samples were sent to the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale for next generation sequencing in order to determine whether this recent Ebola case is linked to a new spill over event or to a resurgence of the outbreak that affected North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces in 2018-2020.As of 8 February 2021, a total of 117 contacts has been identified and are under follow up. Investigations and response activities are ongoing.There are currently therapeutics (Regeneron and mAb114) available for up to 400 patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Preliminary information indicates that the patient visited at least three health facilities in two health zones and was unsafely buried in a third health zone. There is therefore a risk of EVD spreading to other health zones. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.The resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. The risk of re-emergence through exposure to animal hosts or bodily fluids of Ebola survivors cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak.There are a number of ongoing challenges for surveillance, including access to affected areas and community mistrust toward authorities and outbreak responders. Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys and apes:To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids:To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme.

A respiratory specimen was collected on 14 January. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing conducted at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene indicated a presumptive positive influenza A(H3N2) variant virus infection. The specimen was forwarded to the Influenza Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 21 January for further testing. On 22 January, CDC confirmed an influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection using RT-PCR and genome sequence analysis. Investigation into the source of the infection has been completed and revealed that the child lives on a farm with swine present. Sampling of the swine on the property for influenza virus has not yet been conducted but is planned. Five family members of the patient reported respiratory illness during the investigation and were tested for influenza; all tested negative. The patient was prescribed antiviral treatment and was not hospitalized and has made a full recovery. No human to human transmission has been identified associated with this investigation.Sequencing of the virus by CDC revealed it is similar to A (H3N2) viruses circulating in swine in the mid-western United States during 2019-2020. Viruses related to this A (H3N2)v virus were previously circulating as human seasonal A (H3N2) viruses until around 2010-2011 when they entered the USA swine population. Thus, past vaccination or infection with human seasonal A (H3N2) virus is likely to offer some protection in humans.This is the first influenza A (H3N2)v virus identified in the United States in 2021. Since 2005, a total of 485 influenza variant virus human infections caused by all subtypes including 437 human infections with A (H3N2)v, including this one, have been reported in the United States.According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact. A novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if (1) the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect and transmit efficiently among humans; and (2) differs from currently-circulating seasonal human influenza viruses such that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population; and (3) the population has little to no immunity against it. Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease. Nevertheless, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely.CDC and Wisconsin State Authorities have taken the following monitoring, prevention and control measuresSince 2005, there has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, but no ongoing community transmission has been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.Influenza viruses that infect pigs may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. In addition, pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they may get infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no immunity, an influenza pandemic can occur.The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.Due to the evolution influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for further characterization and risk assessment.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report\u00a0.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and potentially contaminated environments and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacity for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources have been redirected towards SARS-CoV-2. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is working to increase the testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV infections.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Given limited capacities in countries for testing, WHO advises that countries should test all suspect MERS-CoV cases, and a subset sample of severe acute respiratory infections for MERS-CoV.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/cholera-togo", "date_of_publication": "2021-01-04", "headline": "Cholera - Togo", "main_text": "From 11 November to 28 December, 2020 a total of 67 suspected cholera cases presenting with diarrhea and vomiting, including two deaths a case fatality ratio (CFR: 3%) were reported from the municipalities \u201cGolfe 1\u201d and \u201cGolfe 6\u201d in Lom\u00e9, Togo.

On 19 November, the Minister of Health, Public Hygiene and Universal Access to Care of Togo issued a press release declaring a cholera outbreak and on 24 November WHO was officially notified. From 11 November to 28 December 2020, a total of 17 out of 41 stool samples tested positive for\u00a0Vibrio cholerae\u00a0O1 serotype Ogawa by culture in the National Institute of Hygiene (INH) in Lom\u00e9, Togo.The daily number of cases peaked on 16 November with six cases, including one death. Then, after a decrease in the number of daily cases, they once again peaked with 6 cases reported on both 16 and 22of December. The cases with symptom onset between 11 to 15 November 2020 were found retrospectively by active case searches in health facilities from consultation registers. Of the 67 cases, 19 (28%) were fishermen who move frequently between Togo and neighboring countries (especially Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria). The male / female ratio is 1.48 (40 males and 27 females) with an average age of 24 years.Full response is ongoing in Lom\u00e9, including but not limited to:The possibility of an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign is under discussion.Cholera is an acute enteric infectious disease caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with\u00a0V. cholerae\u00a0bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious disease, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality in the absence of timely treatment. Due to the short incubation period of cholera, outbreaks can develop rapidly depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context involved.Cholera outbreaks have previously occurred in Togo with the last outbreak reported in 2016. The city of Lom\u00e9, currently affected by the outbreak, is one of the known hotspots for cholera. In addition, Togo borders countries where this disease is endemic. A cholera outbreak in the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9, with a population estimated at around of 2 000 000, has so far amounted to 67 suspected cholera cases including two deaths (CFR 3%) of which 17 have been confirmed by culture between 11 November to 28 December 2020.The currently affected health zones (Katanga, Adakpam\u00e9, Gb\u00e9tsogb\u00e9 and Kangnikop\u00e9) are mostly located in port areas with poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. Strong response activities are necessary to prevent the possible spread, given the fishing activities carried out in the affected localities that attract inhabitants from several districts of Lom\u00e9 and other regions of Togo as well as Lom\u00e9\u2019s proximity to Ghana and Benin. One imported confirmed cholera case and one secondary case were reported in the Netherlands in travelers from Togo. The index case was infected in Togo and upon return to the Netherlands tested positive for cholera on 17 November. The partner of the index case developed cholera-like symptoms including \u2018rice water\u2019 diarrhea and vomiting and is considered to have acquired the disease through secondary transmission via the index. Even though there is no risk for further spread of the disease in the Netherlands this event represents an international spread.Togolese health authorities have been implementing all necessary response measures, nevertheless, the possibility of exportation of additional cases to other countries cannot be excluded.With the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to health care access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers and a decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.Another aspect to take into consideration during the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local and national reference laboratories to handle cholera testing due to the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 3 January 2021, Togo reported 3 683 of COVID 19 cases with 68 deaths.Suspected cholera cases are detected based on clinical suspicion in patients who present with severe acute watery diarrhea in at risk areas, areas with ongoing cholera transmission or in persons who have travelled to areas with ongoing transmission. Detection can be facilitated using cholera rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); confirmation is made by culture or PCR. Proper and timely case management in dedicated cholera treatment centers (CTCs), improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to modify behavioral practices, including hand washing, to contain the spread of the disease.WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with the international community based on the information available on the current outbreak.WHO fact sheet on choleraThe Global Task Force on Cholera Control", "reports": {"diseases": ["Cholera"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Togo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON306", "date_of_publication": "2021-01-04", "headline": "Influenza A(H1N2) - Brazil", "main_text": "On 15 December 2020, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported the second confirmed human infection with influenza A(H1N2) variant virus [A(H1N2)v] in Brazil in 2020. The case was a 4 year-old female who lives on a farm which also functions as a swine slaughter in Irati municipality, Paran\u00e1 state. On 16 November 2020, the case had illness onset with a fever, cough, coryza, headache and dyspnea, and was provided ambulatory care on the same day at Darcy Vargas Hospital. He was treated with medication for fever and headache and has recovered. No symptomatic contacts were found among the case\u2019s family.On 18 and 19 November, respiratory samples were collected for testing. The Parana State Laboratory detected an unsubtypeable influenza A virus and the samples were sent to the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Fiocruz), the National Influenza Centre (NIC) in Rio de Janeiro for complete viral genome sequencing, where influenza A(H1N2)v virus was confirmed on 14 December.The A(H1N2)v virus is genetically different from other variant viruses previously detected in humans in Brazil in 2015 and in April 2020, based on preliminary genetic analysis conducted by Fiocruz NIC. The preliminary analysis shows that all genes are most similar to those from currently circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, except for neuraminidase which is most similar to those from influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Further characterization of the virus is underway. All influenza type A viruses detected by sentinel surveillance and viruses submitted from non-sentinel sites (hospital and peripheral laboratories) in Brazil are subtyped by properties of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. To date, no other human infections with variant viruses have been reported in Brazil.This case is the third human infection of influenza A(H1N2)v virus reported in Parana state and in Brazil. The first case was detected in 2015 and the second in April 2020. These two confirmed cases lived in rural areas with pig farming and one case worked in a pig slaughterhouse.Local authorities carried out epidemiological and veterinary investigations to obtain more information about possible exposure, potential suspected cases, clinical features and evolution of the case among other epidemiological, virological and clinical information. While investigations are ongoing, local authorities enhanced laboratory surveillance and subtyping of influenza samples in Irati municipality where the case was reported.There has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. The risk assessment will be reviewed if needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on the geographic location, genetic characteristics of these viruses vary. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant influenza virus\u201d. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or in some cases, contaminated environments. Further human cases can be expected because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world.Influenza viruses which infect swine may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. In addition, pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person, an influenza pandemic can occur.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)] and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.In case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. Epidemiologic investigations should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal human-to-human transmission. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for influenza for further characterization.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Influenza A(H1N2)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Brazil", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON305", "date_of_publication": "2020-12-31", "headline": "COVID-19 - Global", "main_text": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has had a major impact on human health globally; infecting a large number of people; causing severe disease and associated long-term health sequelae; resulting in death and excess mortality, especially among older and vulnerable populations; interrupting routine healthcare services; disruptions to travel, trade, education and many other societal functions; and more broadly having a negative impact on peoples physical and mental health. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has received several reports of unusual public health events possibly due to variants of SARS-CoV-2. WHO routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 result in changes in transmissibility, clinical presentation and severity, or if they impact on countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Previous reports of the D614G mutation and the recent reports of virus variants from the Kingdom of Denmark, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of South Africa have raised interest and concern in the impact of viral changes.A variant of SARS-CoV-2 with a D614G substitution in the gene encoding the spike protein emerged in late January or early February 2020. Over a period of several months, the D614G mutation replaced the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain identified in China and by June 2020 became the dominant form of the virus circulating globally. Studies in human respiratory cells and in animal models demonstrated that compared to the initial virus strain, the strain with the D614G substitution has increased infectivity and transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G substitution does not cause more severe illness or alter the effectiveness of existing laboratory diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, or public health preventive measures.In August and September 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 variant linked to\u00a0infection among farmed mink\u00a0and subsequently transmitted to humans, was identified in North Jutland, Denmark. The variant, referred to as the \u201cCluster 5\u201d variant by Danish authorities, has a combination of mutations not previously observed. Due preliminary studies conducted in Denmark, there is concern that this variant has may result in reduced virus neutralization in humans, which could potentially decrease the extend and duration of immune protection following natural infection or vaccination. Studies are ongoing to assess virus neutralization among humans with this variant. To date, following extensive investigation and surveillance, Danish authorities have identified only 12 human cases of the Cluster 5 variant in September 2020, and it does not appear to have spread widely.On 14 December 2020, authorities of the United Kingdom reported to WHO a variant referred to by the United Kingdom as SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (Variant of Concern, year 2020, month 12, variant 01). This variant contains 23 nucleotide substitutions and is not phylogenetically related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the United Kingdom at the time the variant was detected. How and where SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 originated is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 initially appeared in South East England but within a few weeks began to replace other virus lineages in this geographic area and London. As of 26 December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has been identified from routine sampling and genomic testing conducted across the United Kingdom . Preliminary epidemiologic, modelling, phylogenetic and clinical findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has increased transmissibility. However, preliminary analyses also indicate that there is no change in disease severity (as measured by length of hospitalization and 28-day case fatality), or occurrence of reinfection between variant cases compared to other SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the United Kingdom.1\u00a0Another of the mutations in the VOC 202012/01 variant, the deletion at position 69/70del was found to affect the performance of some diagnostic PCR assays with an S gene target. Most PCR assays in use worldwide will use multiple targets and therefore the impact of the variant on diagnostics is not anticipated to be significant. Laboratory evaluation has demonstrated no significant impact on the performance of antigen-based lateral flow devices. As of 30 December, VOC-202012/01 variant has been reported in 31 other countries/territories/areas in five of the six WHO regions.On 18 December, national authorities in South Africa announced the detection of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that is rapidly spreading in three provinces of South Africa. South Africa has named this variant 501Y.V2, because of a N501Y mutation. While SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 from the UK also has the N501Y mutation, phylogenetic analysis has shown that 501Y.V2 from South Africa are different virus variants. In the week beginning 16 November, routine sequencing by South African health authorities found that this new SARS-CoV-2 variant has largely replaced other SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. While genomic data highlighted that the 501.V2 variant rapidly displaced other lineages circulating in South Africa, and preliminary studies suggest the variant is associated with a higher viral load, which may suggest potential for increased transmissibility, this, as well as other factors that influence transmissibility, are subject of further investigation. Moreover, at this stage, there is no clear evidence of the new variant being associated with more severe disease or worse outcomes. Further investigations are needed to understand the impact on transmission, clinical severity of infection, laboratory diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, or public health preventive measures. As of 30 December, the 501Y.V2 variant from South Africa has been reported from four other countries to date.The authorities in the affected countries are conducting epidemiological and virological investigations to further assess the transmissibility, severity, risk of reinfection and antibody response to new variants. As one of the mutations (N501Y) \u2013 found in both the SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 variants \u2013 is in the receptor binding domain, the authorities are investigating the neutralization activity of sera from recovered and vaccinated patients against these variants to determine if there is any impact on vaccine performance. These studies are ongoing.Genomic data of the SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 variants has been shared by the national authorities and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) and genomic surveillance of the virus continues, globally.The following activities have been initiated:As part of WHO\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 global laboratory network, which has monitored virus mutations from the start of the pandemic, a specific working group on virus evolution was established in June 2020, composed of experts in sequencing, bioinformatics, and in vivo and in vitro laboratory studies. The Virus Evolution Working Group works to 1) strengthen mechanisms to identify and prioritize (potentially) relevant mutations; 2) identify relevant mutations early and study the potential impacts related to viral characteristics (e.g. virulence, transmission) and effectiveness of available and future countermeasures (e.g. diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics); 3) evaluate possible mitigation strategies to reduce the negative impact of mutations; and 4) study the impact of specific mutations, including laboratory-controlled in vitro and in vivo studies of variants. Sharing of full genome sequences is facilitating detailed analyses by partners. The Working Group is collaborating with international scientists with a broad scope of expertise in virology in general and coronaviruses specifically to better understand the research findings and support further studies.All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time, most without a direct benefit to the virus in terms of increasing its infectiousness or transmissibility, and sometimes limiting propagation (see\u00a0Q&A on COVID-19 and related health topics\u00a0). The potential for virus mutation increases with the frequency of human and animal infections. Therefore, reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by using established disease control methods as well as avoiding introductions to animal populations, are critical aspects to the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications.Preliminary data suggest that the growth rate and effective reproductive number is elevated in areas of the United Kingdom with community circulation of the novel variant VOC-202012/01. In South Africa, genomic data highlighted that the 501Y.V2 variant rapidly displaced other lineages circulating, and preliminary studies suggest the variant is associated with a higher viral load, which may suggest potential for increased transmissibility; however, this, as well as other factors that influence transmissibility, are subject of further investigation. Epidemiologic investigations are underway to understand the increase in cases in these communities and the potential role of increased transmissibility of these variants as well as the robustness of implementation of control measures. While initial assessment suggests that 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 do not cause changes in clinical presentation or severity, if they result in a higher case incidence, this would lead to an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. More intensive public health measures may be required to control transmission of these variants.Further investigations are required to understand the impact of specific mutations on viral properties and the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. These investigations are complex and require time and collaboration among different research groups. These studies are ongoing.National and local authorities should continue to strengthen existing disease control activities, including monitoring their epidemics closely through ongoing\u00a0epidemiological surveillance\u00a0and strategic\u00a0testing; conducting outbreak investigation and contact tracing; and where appropriate,\u00a0adjusting public health and social measures\u00a0to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.WHO further advises countries, where feasible, to increase routine systematic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to better understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to monitor for the emergence of variants. Sequence data should be shared internationally through publicly accessible databases. In countries with sequencing capacity, WHO advises sequencing of isolates from a systematically selected subset of SARS-CoV-2 infections \u2013 the amount will depend on local capacities. Genetic sequencing should also be considered as part of investigations of unusual transmission events (e.g. increased transmission in spite of existing control measures) or unexpected disease presentation/severity. Where limited sequencing capacity exists, countries are encouraged to increase capacity in collaboration with public, academic and private sequencing laboratories, and may arrange sequencing at collaborating laboratories in the\u00a0COVID-19 reference laboratory network.While mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are expected, it is important to continue to monitor the public health implications of new virus variants. Any increased in transmissibility associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants could make control more difficult. Current disease control measures recommended by WHO continue to be effective and should be adapted in response to increasing disease incidence, whether associated with a new variant or not.Prevention advice and communications for the public should be further strengthened, including precautions to\u00a0protect yourself and others\u00a0such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Moreover,\u00a0infection prevention and control guidance and measures\u00a0should reinforced, including:WHO has recently published an interim guidance \u2013 \"Considerations for implementing a risk-based approach to international travel in the context of COVID-19\", recommending the following principles for international travelers in the context of COVID-19 Pandemic:Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers, including to and from the countries affected by the new variants, with aforementioned information, via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry, as well as communities adjacent to land borders with affected countries.The interim guidance also provides countries with a risk-based approach to decision-making, calibrating travel-related risk mitigation measures in the context of international travel, aiming at reducing travel-associated exportation, importation and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. Some countries have recently introduced travel restrictions as a precautionary measure in response to the appearance of new variants. WHO recommends that all countries take a risk-based approach for adjusting measures in the context of international travel, which includes assessing local transmission, health services capacity, what is known about the level of transmissibility of specific variants; social and economic impact of restrictions; and adherence to public health and social measures. National authorities are encouraged to publish their risk assessment methodology and the list of departure countries or areas to which restrictions apply; and these should be updated regularly.In line with the advice provided by the Emergency Committee on COVID-19 at its\u00a0most recent meeting, WHO recommends that States Parties should regularly re-consider measures applied to international travel in compliance with Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005) and continue to provide information and rationale to WHO on measures that significantly interfere with international traffic. Countries should also ensure that measures affecting international traffic are risk-based, evidence-based, coherent, proportionate and time limited.In all circumstances, essential travel (e.g., emergency responders; providers of public health technical support; critical personnel in transport and security sector such as seafarers; repatriations; and cargo transport for essential supplies such as food, medicines and fuel) identified by countries should always be prioritized and facilitated.1\u00a0Public Health England.\u00a0Investigation of novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, Variant of Concern 202012/01 Technical briefing 2- 28 December 2020.

The outbreak consists of a cluster of four confirmed cases from three health zones in Kidira health district, Tambacounda region; one case in the neighbouring Kedougou health district, Kedougou region; one case in Saraya health district, Kedougou region; and one case in Thilogne health district, Matam region.In Tambacounda region, on 18 October 2020, a sample was collected from a 40 year-old female living in Kidira district during an investigation for West Nile virus infection. On 29 October, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) confirmed the case as yellow fever. On 31 October, IPD reported results of a second confirmed case of YF to national health authorities, following a notification by Bakel health zone, Kidira health district. The case was an 8 year-old boy whose illness began in Kidira health district and died on 31 October. On 12 November, IPD notified national health authorities about a third confirmed case, a 23 year-old male, who was detected by routine surveillance and died on 5 November. On 16 November, a fourth confirmed case, a 15 year-old boy from Kidira health district, was reported to national health authorities. The two deaths among the four cases reported in Kidira health district occurred at two hospitals: one at the Matam regional hospital and the other at the Tambacounda regional hospital.In Kedougou and Matam regions, three confirmed cases were reported in December 2020, whose samples were collected during various investigations. In Kedougou region, laboratory tests conducted by IPD revealed that out of the 16 samples received from region, there were:In Matam region, one case was confirmed as YF by IgM and PRNT. The case is a 90-year-old male from Thilogne health district, who is hospitalized in a private clinic in Dakar.The Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks (STAR), which was used prior to notification of the third case in Kidira health district, classified YF as \"low\", where small outbreaks can be observed but likely not a large outbreak.The Ministry of Health is coordinating a rapid response. Recommended response activities include immunization of the local population, enhanced surveillance, risk communication, community engagement and vector control. Additional potential support for vaccines and operational costs may be requested by the country.The detection of YF cases in the Tambacounda and Kedougou regions demonstrates the possibility of sylvatic spread of YF to unvaccinated people in a rural area and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high population immunity in all countries located in areas at high risk for YF. Recent epidemiological studies have reported that the villages are in a savanna area with non-human primates. Permanent or temporary pools of water are observed at the outskirts of residential areas.Although mass vaccination took place in Senegal in 2007, the eastern part of the country is considered to be at high risk of endemic YF transmission. Unvaccinated individuals remain vulnerable to infection with YF due to the persistence of the disease in primates (sylvatic cycle), especially in rural areas. The two affected regions are also difficult to reach, making vaccination efforts challenging. Intensive care units in the regions are far from the district (186 km) with poor road conditions. Affected districts are rural, largely consisted of forests, making it difficult to control the vector and mitigate the combined sylvatic-urban cycle.The COVID-19 pandemic poses a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to the burden on health systems and declining immunization uptake due to physical distancing or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the number of susceptible individuals and increase the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. As of 27 December 2020, there were 18 523 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 387 deaths reported in Senegal.YF is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and have serious public health consequences. There is no specific treatment, although the disease can be prevented with a single dose of YF vaccine, which confers lifelong immunity. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections are recommended.Senegal is considered a high priority country by the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. The introduction of YF vaccination into routine vaccination took place in January 2005. Vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling YF. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also useful to stop transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities in implementing these interventions to control the current epidemic.WHO recommends YF vaccination for all international travelers aged 9-months or older traveling to Senegal. Senegal also requires a YF vaccination certificate for travelers aged 9-months or older from countries at risk of YF transmission and travelers who have transited more than 12 hours at an airport of a country that is at risk of transmitting YF.YF vaccination is safe, highly effective and offers protection for life. In accordance with the International Health Regulaions (2005), third edition, the validity of the international YF vaccination certificate extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of YF vaccine cannot be required from international travelers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guidelines for vaccination activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidelines for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19. Where conditions permit, the EYE strategy will support the rapid resumption of YF prevention activities.WHO encourages Member States to take all necessary measures to keep travelers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travelers should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of YF and should consult a physician promptly when showing signs. Returning viremic travelers may pose a risk to the establishment of local YF transmission cycles in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Senegal based on the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Senegal", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON302", "date_of_publication": "2020-12-23", "headline": "Yellow Fever - Guinea", "main_text": "The Koundara Health District, where 50 of the 52 cases (96%) were reported, has 7 health areas including an urban commune (Koundara Center). The geographic distribution of the notifications are as follows:Of the 50 suspected YF cases from Koundara 34 (68%) were male. For cases in Koundara, the most affected age group is 5-14 years with 27 cases (59%), followed by 1-4 years with 14 cases (30%) and the age group \u2265 15 years with 5 cases (11%). Out of 14 registered deaths, 9 occurred at a hospital and 5 in the community. Among the 14 deaths, 4 samples were taken; all of which were negative for YF.The yellow fever vaccination status for the 50 notified cases within Koundara from 06 November to 09 December is as follows: vaccinated (without card) 1 case (2%); unvaccinated: 31 cases (62%); and status unknown: 18 cases (36%).Following the notification of the first three confirmed IgM positive cases, 2 912 children (9-59m) were vaccinated against yellow fever.Guinea is a high risk endemic country according to the EYE (Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics) global strategy classification. The country thus implements routine vaccination for children from 9 months of age, international travelers and organizes preventive and response campaigns according to the epidemiological context. According to WHO-UNICEF estimates, the vaccination coverage against yellow fever in Guinea has been 40% for the years 2016 to 2019, beneath the level necessary to sustain population immunity. A survey of yellow fever vaccination carried out in the community in Koundara district found that coverage is very low (16%). This low coverage suggests that a high proportion of the population is at risk, particularly children born after the 2005 mass vaccination campaign in Boke and any older person who was missed in past vaccination campaigns. The last tranche of preventive mass vaccination campaigns in Guinea was completed in 2010.An entomological survey was carried out to identify and investigate the likely points of contact between Aedes mosquitoes and humans. The capture of nymphs or larvae in backwaters, water supply points, households and surrounding stagnant water in the localities of Sareboilo, Guingan, Kamaby and Urban Commune revealed mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, with the possibility of direct contact with the local population. In addition, in the prefecture of Koundara, there are factors conducive to sylvatic spillover of YF virus into human populations, including the presence of many non-human primates (NHPs) and the natural and animal parks (Ni\u00e9kolobadjar Park and the classified forest of N\u2019Dama where NHPs are found).The Koundara Health District Public Health Emergency Operation Center set up a response coordinated by the Ministry of Health. Response activities implemented include in-depth investigations around suspected YF cases, active case finding, initial reactive vaccination around suspected YF cases, clinical management, vector control, risk communication and community engagement, transport and analysis of samples to the laboratory in Conakry and the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, communication within the framework of the IHR, and the development of an ongoing response plan.WHO and its partners will continue to support local authorities in implementing targeted vector control measures in urban centres to interrupt transmission to control the current epidemic.Eight IgM positive cases were reported from four prefectures of Koundara district. Subsequent analysis by the regional reference laboratory IPD has confirmed yellow fever. The district is noted to have risk factors for a spread of the yellow fever virus, including documented Aedes species, parks inhabited by monkeys, forests extending to neighboring countries (Senegal, Guinea Bissau) and suboptimal YF vaccination coverage. The occurrence of suspected YF cases in urban and peri-urban areas with largely unvaccinated populations increases the risk of epidemic amplification.The risk at the national level is considered high because of the large number of cases with an unusual age profile of young children in a short period of time, with a focus in Koundara. The risk at the regional level is considered moderate given the geographic location of the suspected YF cases and potential population movements.Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and have serious public health consequences. There is no specific treatment, although the disease can be prevented with a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides lifelong immunity. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections are recommended. Vaccination is the most important way to prevent infection.Guinea is one of a group of 27 high risk endemic countries according to the EYE (Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics Global Strategy) classification. The reactive mass vaccination campaigns, organized as a matter of urgency to protect populations during the 2002 YF epidemic, helped limit the impact of the epidemic. Guinea conducted phased preventive vaccination campaigns against yellow fever in 2005 and 2010 , with a 95% vaccination coverage. Vaccination is the main way to prevent and control yellow fever. The unusual age profile of the current cluster of suspected YF cases highlights both the importance of maintaining strong YF vaccination coverage through routine immunization, and also the importance of ruling out other causes of acute febrile jaundice through differential diagnosis.Vaccination against yellow fever is safe, highly effective and provides lifelong protection. According to IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends for the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travelers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guidelines for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-Framework_Mass_Vaccination-2020.1) and is currently developing specific operational guidelines for conducting mass immunization campaigns in the context of COVID-19. The EYE strategy encourages immunization of all eligible children in through routine immunization.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travelers aged 9 months and over, to Guinea. Guinea also requires a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever for travelers aged 9 months and over coming from countries at risk of yellow fever transmission, and for travelers who have passed through the airport for more than 12 hours.WHO encourages Member States to take all necessary measures to keep travelers well informed about YF risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of the symptoms and signs of yellow fever and be advised to seek medical attention promptly when they show signs. Returning viraemic travelers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the vector is present.The updated areas at risk for yellow fever transmission and related recommendations for vaccination of international travelers were updated by WHO on July 1, 2020; the revised risk area map and yellow fever vaccination recommendations are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade in Guinea based on the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Guinea", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON304", "date_of_publication": "2020-12-21", "headline": "COVID-19 - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "main_text": "On 14 December 2020, authorities of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland reported to WHO that a new SARS-CoV-2 variant was identified through viral genomic sequencing. This variant is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01). Initial analysis indicates that the variant may spread more readily between people. Investigations are ongoing to determine if this variant is associated with any changes in the severity of symptoms, antibody response or vaccine efficacy.A total of 1108 cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 have been detected in the United Kingdom as of 13 December 2020. The variant was picked up as part of an epidemiological and virological investigation initiated earlier in December 2020 following an unexpected rise in COVID-19 cases in South East England. It was characterized by a more than three-fold increase in the 14-day case notification rate from epidemiological week 41 to week 50 (5 October to 13 December 2020). On average, between 5 - 10% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses have routinely been sequenced in the United Kingdom and 4% routinely sequenced in South East England since the beginning of the pandemic. From 5 October to 13 December, over 50% of isolates were identified as the variant strain in South East England. Retrospective analysis traced the first identified variant to Kent, South East England, on 20 September 2020, which was followed by a rapid increase of the same variant identified later in November. Most COVID-19 cases from whom this variant has been identified have occurred in people under 60 years of age.The variant is defined by the presence of a range of 14 mutations resulting in amino acid changes and three deletions. Some of these mutations may influence the transmissibility of the virus in humans:The new VUI-202012/01 variant has been identified in several countries including Australia, Denmark, Italy, Iceland and the Netherlands.Preliminary reports by the United Kingdom are that this variant is more transmissible than previous circulating viruses, with an estimated increase of between 40% and 70% in transmissibility (adding 0.4 to the basic reproduction number R0, bringing it to a range of 1.5 to 1.7). Laboratory studies are ongoing to determine whether these variant viruses have different biological properties or alter vaccine efficacy. There is not enough information at present to determine if this variant is associated with any change in severity of clinical disease, antibody response or vaccine efficacy.The authorities in the United Kingdom are conducting epidemiological and virological investigations to further assess the transmissibility, infection-severity, risk of reinfection and antibody response of this new variant. As one of the mutations (N501Y) is in the receptor binding domain, the authorities are urgently investigating the neutralization activity of sera from recovered and vaccinated patients against this variant to determine if there is any impact on vaccine performance.Genomic data of this variant has been uploaded to GISAID by the authorities of the United Kingdom and genomic surveillance of the virus continues across the country to monitor the situation.On 19 December 2020, authorities in the United Kingdom announced that affected areas would be subject to Tier 4 restrictions including reduced social gatherings, tighter movement restrictions, requests to work from home wherever possible, and closures of non-essential businesses.All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time, but most of these mutations or changes do not have a direct benefit to the virus or may even be detrimental to its propagation. Further laboratory investigations are required to more fully understand the impact of specific mutation on viral properties and the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. These investigations are complex and require time and collaboration amongst different research groups.The sharing of full genome sequences is facilitating detailed analyses by partners. The WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group is working with colleagues from the United Kingdom to better understand the available results and support further studies.Further epidemiological and laboratory-based studies are rapidly required to understand the implications of these viruses in terms of available SARS-CoV-2 clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and vaccine development.The preliminary findings by the United Kingdom signal the broader issue of SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations, and WHO underscores the importance of prompt sharing of epidemiological, virological and full genome sequence information with other countries and research teams, including through open-source platforms such as GISAID and others.WHO advises that further epidemiological and virological studies be conducted to understand the specific mutations described by the United Kingdom and other countries to further investigate any changes in the function of the virus in terms of infectivity and pathogenicity. WHO advises all countries to increase the routine sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible, and sharing of sequence data internationally, in particular, to report if the same mutations of concern are found.WHO would like to draw attention to the concern about the reported loss of performance of PCR assays that target the spike (S) gene of the virus. Laboratories using commercial PCR kits for which the targeted viral genes are not clearly identified in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions are advised to contact the manufacturer for more information. Laboratories using in-house PCR assays that target the S gene of the virus should also be aware of this potential issue. In order to limit the impact on the detection capacities in the countries, an approach using different assays in parallel or multiplex assays targeting different viral genes is also recommended to allow the detection of potential arising variants.All countries need to assess their level of local transmission and apply appropriate prevention and control activities including adapting public health and social measures as per WHO guidance.It is important to remind communities and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections:WHO recommends the health measures as listed above for all travelers, including to and from the United Kingdom. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport, and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections, via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators, and at points of entry.In line with the advice provided by the Emergency Committee on COVID-19 at its most recent meeting, WHO recommends that States Parties should regularly re-consider measures applied to international travel in compliance with Article 43 of the IHR (2005) and continue to provide information and rationale to WHO on measures that significantly interfere with international traffic. Countries should also ensure that measures affecting international traffic are risk-based, evidence-based, coherent, proportionate and time limited.WHO has recently published an interim guidance \u2013 \"Considerations for implementing a risk-based approach to international travel in the context of COVID-19\", to provide countries with a risk based approach to decision-making process for calibrating travel related risk mitigation measures in the context of international travel, aiming at reducing travel-associated exportation, importation and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic.WHO recommends that countries take a risk-based approach. National authorities are encouraged to publish their risk assessment methodology and the list of departure countries to which restrictions apply; and these should be updated regularly. In all circumstances, essential travel (e.g., emergency responders; providers of public health technical support; critical personnel in transport and security sector such as seafarers; repatriations; and cargo transport for essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel) identified by countries should always be prioritized and facilitated.", "reports": {"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Kingdom of Great Britain ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Northern Ireland", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON301", "date_of_publication": "2020-12-03", "headline": "COVID-19 - Denmark", "main_text": "Since June 2020, Danish authorities have reported an extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on mink farms in Denmark. On 5 November, the Danish public health authorities reported\u00a0the detection of a mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a combination of mutations not previously observed (referred to as \u201cCluster 5\u201d) in 12 human cases in North Jutland, detected from August to September 2020.To date, Statens Serum Institut (SSI) in Denmark has identified seven unique mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 among variants co-circulating in mink and humans. SSI cultured the \u201cCluster 5\u201d variant with four amino acid changes in the spike protein, which was identified in mink and isolated from the 12 human cases reported in North Jutland. Preliminary findings suggested that there was a lower capability of antibodies to neutralize the Cluster 5 strain, which requires further investigation.Following public health measures implemented by Danish authorities, the incidence of COVID-19 in North Jutland decreased from 100 per 100,000 population in the week beginning 2 November (week 45) to 60 per 100,000 population in the week beginning 16 November (week 47). Over the past weeks, Danish authorities have conducted mass testing of 111 447 individuals in North Jutland using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and are planning to conduct genetic sequencing for all positive samples.In November 2020, 349 cases were reported among people associated with mink farming, an increase from 200 cases in October 2020. Since June 2020, a total of 644 people associated with mink farming have tested positive. Furthermore, there have been at least 338 cases reported among people working with mink pelting, in six factories and two small facilities, which suggests that there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in people who are involved in farming, culling and pelting of mink. As of 1 December 2020, a total of 289 mink farms have been affected, which accounts for approximately 20% of all mink farms in Denmark.From the week beginning 6 June 2020 (week 24) to the week beginning 16 November 2020 (week 47), 10 386 COVID-19 positive samples from unique individuals underwent whole genome sequencing, which accounted for 17.6% of all positive samples in the corresponding time period. Of these sequenced samples, 750 were virus variants associated with infected mink. In addition, at least two new SARS-CoV-2 variants were recently detected in Southern Denmark which were not genetically related to the original Danish mink-associated variant strain.In North Denmark, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated variant strains among all sequenced samples decreased from 60% and 51% in weeks 41 and 42, respectively, to 26% and 31% in weeks 46 and 47; in Central Denmark, the proportion increased from ~3% in weeks 41 and 42 to over 30% in weeks 46 and 47; in South Denmark, the proportion increased from 0% in weeks 41 and 42 to 11% and 21% in weeks 46 and 47, respectively, while noting that there are differences in sequencing frequency and practices among various regions. In areas with no affected mink farms, human cases infected with the mink-associated variant have occurred sporadically. As of 20 November, no new human cases of the Cluster 5 strain have been detected by genetic sequencing, and authorities assessed that the Cluster 5 variant is no longer circulating in humans.Mink have previously been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, including in two outbreaks on large mink farms in the Netherlands in April 2020. Additionally, the Netherlands have reported human infections with mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 strains which were not Cluster 5 strains. To date, eight countries, namely Denmark, Lithuania, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy, and Greece and the United States of America have reported COVID-19 in farmed mink to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).On 4 November 2020, Denmark decided to cull all farmed mink in Denmark. This decision was made following information that it had not been possible to prevent the spread of infection from farm to farm, or from animals to humans, and mink are acting as a reservoir and contributing to the ongoing transmission in Denmark. On 5 November, movement restrictions were introduced in the affected areas in North Jutland. On 6 November, Denmark shared the full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from humans to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) platform, and 133 sequences from mink on 18 November. On 19 November 2020, restrictions were lifted in North Jutland due to decreased incidence and the absence of new cases of the Cluster 5 variant identified in the affected areas.By 25 November, mink on all 289 affected mink farms, and farms within an assigned zone, were culled. Additionally, mink farming has been banned in Denmark until 31 December 2021, including import and export of live mink. Economic support packages have been established for those affected.Danish authorities have continued to work with the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group and have agreed to share the Cluster 5 variant SARS-CoV-2 with the COVID-19 Reference Laboratory Network for further studies and testing.It is expected that all viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 change over time. SARS-CoV-2 strains which are infecting mink and subsequently transmitted back to humans, may have acquired unique mutations to adapt to the mink host. Advanced laboratory studies are required to fully understand the impact of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 on viral properties such as transmissibility, clinical presentation and effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. These studies are long, complex and are done in close collaboration with various research groups.While public health and social measures implemented by Denmark have led to positive developments, recent findings of other mink-associated variants among human cases in mid-Jutland and the detection of some 200 human cases among workers are of concern.This event highlights the important role that farmed mink populations can play in the on-going transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the critical importance of robust surveillance, sampling and sequencing of these viruses by employing a One Health approach, especially around areas where such animal reservoirs are identified. The global relevance of the preliminary findings by Denmark is potentially significant, and WHO recognizes the importance of prompt sharing of epidemiological, virological, and full genome sequence information with other countries and research teams, including through open-source platforms such as GISAID.WHO advises the following measures:WHO recommends the health measures listed above for all travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions for Denmark based on information currently available in relation to this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Denmark", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON300", "date_of_publication": "2020-11-27", "headline": "Acute hepatitis E - Burkina Faso", "main_text": "Between 8 September and 24 November, 2020, the North-Central region of Burkina Faso reported a cumulative total of 442 cases of febrile jaundice. The vast majority of cases (87.5%) were reported from Barsalogho health district with 387 cases and 16 deaths, representing a case-fatality rate of 4.1% (see Figure 1 and 2). A total of 15 out of 16 deaths were reported in pregnant or postpartum women.A total of 10 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Currently 38 patients are being followed up at the Barsalogho medical center; 10 of which are in hospital. Case descriptions according to individual characteristics show that 67% of cases were less than 30 years old (mean age is 25 \u00b1 12 years); 54% of febrile jaundice cases were female; and nearly 5% of cases were less than 5 years old.As early as 11 September, WHO advised the Ministry of Health that the cause could be hepatitis E given the following contexts:There are many internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region, most of them with host families and some living in camps . In addition, the North-Central region is affected by the closure of health facilities due to insecurity resulting from regular attacks by Unidentified Armed Men (HANI). In the Health District of Barsalogho, three out of four communes are heavily affected by these attacks resulting in displacement of the population. A total of 40% of the country's IDPs are registered in the North-Central region, but only 6 out of 15 health facilities are in operation. Burkina Faso is affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and as of 23 November, 2020, 2 757 cases and 68 deaths have been reported. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic further complicates the response.The following response actions have been carried out or are underway at country level:CoordinationSurveillanceCase managementWASHAlthough hepatitis A, B, and C are common in Burkina Faso, this is the first-time hepatitis E has been reported in the country. The national HIV/hepatitis reference laboratory at the Muraz Center in Bobo Dioulasso has an efficient technical platform capable of diagnosing hepatitis E but lacks reagents and rapid diagnostic kits. Efforts to improve case management and strengthen surveillance are ongoing. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported within Barsalogho health district, which houses many internally displaced persons (IDPs) experiencing difficult living conditions. Aside from overcrowding, the main contributing factors leading to this outbreak could be limited access to clean water and poor sanitation and hygiene in the affected areas.The level of risk at the national level is considered moderate: given that this is a hepatitis E epidemic, occurring in a geographical area where the population has little access to essential water, and sanitation and hygiene services, requiring the implementation of effective and rapid prevention measures. Since January 2019, the North-Central region has been regularly subject to attacks by unidentified armed men (HANI), resulting in a dysfunction in the provision of care and the massive displacement of populations. The spread of this epidemic to other neighbouring health districts is possible if additional support measures are not put in place. The limited capacity of local actors to effectively support the response actions also constitute a risk of spreading this epidemic to other sub-prefectures or neighbouring health districts.The risk at the regional and global level remains low.Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas of humanitarian emergencies.The hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, allowing the viruses excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. In general, the infection heals spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a lethality of 0.5-4%. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their second and third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 20-25% in women in the last trimester of pregnancy.Prevention is the most effective approach against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV and the number of hepatitis E cases are: provision of safe drinking water, quality standards for public water supplies, and the provision of adequate sanitation. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap - especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.To prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in neighbourhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable health care services to combat hepatitis E epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Since the incubation period for hepatitis E ranges from 2-10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the tenth week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.The intervention must continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, improving the population's hygiene conditions, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries.To date, a hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risk, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals, such as pregnant women.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Acute hepatitis E"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Burkina Faso", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON299", "date_of_publication": "2020-11-24", "headline": "Yellow Fever - Nigeria", "main_text": "Reports of a cluster of deaths from an undiagnosed disease were notified on 1 November 2020 through Event Based Surveillance in two states, Delta and Enugu, located in southern Nigeria. The Delta State health surveillance system had been informed of the outbreak on 30 October 2020, following a cluster of deaths presenting with similar symptoms.On 2 November 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported to WHO a cluster of deaths in Ute Okpu community in Ika North-East local government area (LGA) of Delta State. Additional cases were reported from 4 other wards of Ika North-East (Idumessah, Owa Alero, Owanta, and Umunede). A preliminary report for Delta State on 5 November 2020, notified of 48 suspected cases of yellow fever (YF) with 30 deaths (CFR 62.5%). The most frequent symptoms included 1-week history of fever, vomiting (with or without blood), bleeding, seizures, and unconsciousness. One patient was reported to have cough, sore throat, and hiccups. Of those 48 reported cases, the main occupation was farmers, and males were predominantly affected (75%). The YF vaccination status of most of the suspected cases is unknown. The index case developed symptoms on 24 July 2020 and died on 28 July 2020. Preliminary investigation did not reveal any significant travel history. Two blood samples were collected, along with nasal and throat swabs on 31 October 2020. Laboratory investigations were carried out at the mobile laboratory of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) in Delta State. All blood samples tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative for Lassa fever and the throat swab was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . Six more blood samples were collected and sent to ISTH, Edo State and all were negative for Lassa fever, while three were positive for YF by PCR. As of 10 November 2020, 65 suspected cases, including 33 deaths, have been reported. Samples were collected from 27 cases and seven have tested positive for yellow fever by PCR.On 4 November 2020, the Enugu State epidemiologist reported a cluster of deaths of unknown cause to NCDC. Investigations by the Rapid Response team for Enugu State on 4 November 2020 reported 10 deaths, with the majority being males aged 4 to 65 years old and with occupations as farmers. The most frequent symptoms included high grade fever, convulsion, and eventually coma, in addition to blood in the urine, mouth bleeding, bleeding in the respiratory tract, blood shot eyes and pain in the flank. The suggestive differential diagnosis was Lassa fever, YF, cerebrospinal meningitis and COVID-19. A total of 13 blood samples were collected and sent to the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja to be tested for viral haemorrhagic fevers. Results received on 10 November 2020 showed 6 PCR positive YF cases in Enugu State.On 8 November 2020, Bauchi State reported 8 samples tested by PCR at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory positive for YF (7/8 from Ganjuwa LGA, 1/8 unknown LGA). Four of these samples were also IgM positive for YF. Detailed case investigations are ongoing, and the line list is currently being updated.On 15 November 2020, 3 PCR positive samples for yellow fever were reported from Ogbadibo LGA in Benue State. These samples were also tested at the NCDC, National Reference Laboratory. Additionally, there has been a PCR positive sample for YF reported from Ohaukwu LGA in Ebonyi State. This LGA has also been the location of a cluster of probable YF cases that were IgM positive at national reference laboratory and had dates of onset July-August 2020. Security challenges in the LGA had hindered full investigation and work-up at the time of initial notification.The outbreak encompasses 5 states in Nigeria: Delta, Enugu, Bauchi, and Benue and Ebonyi (Figure 2).Nigeria is facing concurrent outbreaks of multiple pathogens. Delta State, located in the South-South geo-political zone of the country, is one of the Lassa fever affected states, though not considered one of the YF hot spot states. In 2020, 18 Lassa fever cases have been laboratory confirmed from 140 suspected cases, including 3 fatalities. Enugu state, in the South-East geopolitical zone of the country, shares boundaries with Benue (Ogbadibo LGA) where there are 3 confirmed cases of Lassa fever, and Ebonyi state which is one of the hotspot states for the Lassa fever outbreak. To date, 10 Lassa fever cases have been reported from Enugu state since the start of the year, including 2 fatalities (20% CFR). While Lassa fever cases are reported year-round, the peak period is December to April.The relative proximity of Delta, Enugu, Benue and Ebonyi states with Lagos is an added concern, though population movements (and hence risk of spread) may have been reduced in the COVID-19 context. However, there is a lack of data on this, and the risk of spread should be monitored.COVID-19 response efforts demand an extraordinary amount of time and resources from the country\u2019s health system while lockdowns, travel restrictions and other mitigations to slow the spread have severely disrupted access to core essential health services. National and state authorities are currently focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the human resources required to conduct investigations and response activities for the YF outbreaks. Recent relaxation of COVID-19 measures will increase population mobility thereby increasing the risk for amplification of yellow fever, especially if introduced into urban centres. Population mobility in urban settings can be particularly challenging in conducting mass vaccination campaigns due to the size and diagnostic challenges of the operation (SAGE 2016). As of 23 November 2020, 66 383 COVID cases, including 1 167 deaths, have been reported in Nigeria.The current response at central level:The current response for Delta State:The current response for the cases in Enugu State:The current response for the cases in Bauchi State:The current response for the cases in Benue State:Nigeria is considered a high-risk country by the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. Routine yellow fever vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004 with an estimated coverage of 54% (2019), with lower figures in some sub-groups. Population immunity against yellow fever in many areas around the country remains below herd immunity thresholds: the MICS 2016/2017 indicated that YF vaccination was 39% in children aged 12 to 23 months. To address the risk of outbreaks and increase population immunity, the EYE strategy PMVC component is being implemented in phases. There are over 30 million doses of YF vaccine in the country for PMVCs \u2013 with Delta and Bauchi among the states planned for the current phase of activities. Delta state was already scheduled for a PMVC in 2020. One LGA in Delta state and 4 LGAs in Bauchi state had a vaccination campaign in 2019. This YF vaccine supply and associated preparations could serve to meet the needs of outbreak response. The supplies also include resources such as PPE and hand sanitizers for COVID-19 prevention in a mass vaccination campaign. Enugu and Ebonyi are not included in the current planned PMVCs, however there is a possibility that vaccines and associated supplies in the country might help support an immediate response. By 2024, it is anticipated that all the states in Nigeria will have undergone campaign activities to protect at-risk populations against yellow fever. This plan may be further updated or accelerated based on risk, vaccine availability, and implementation feasibility.Nigeria is a high-risk country for yellow fever. The re-emergence of yellow fever in September 2017 in Nigeria has been marked by outbreaks over a wide geographical area. The yellow fever outbreaks reported in Bauchi, Benue and Katsina states from August to November 2019, with spread to multiple other states showed an expansion of YF transmission, and an elevated risk for YF outbreaks to rapidly spread and amplify, impacting areas without prior reported cases since 2017 and in areas with large under immunized populations. In the current year, suspected YF cases have been reported from all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and confirmed YF cases across 9 states (Delta, Enugu, Bauchi, Benue, Kogi, Oyo, Edo Kwara and Katsina). These new outbreaks in Bauchi, Delta and Enugu are affecting areas without prior reported cases this year and suggest underlying sustained high viral transmission in the epizootic cycle with spillover to human populations. Due to: the risk of spread to other states with under-immunized populations, including to large urban centers; the high CFR; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to suboptimal vaccination coverage; and the occurrence of cases in peri-urban areas (e.g. in Delta State) and densely populated LGAs with proximity to Lagos, the risk is high.There is no entomological information currently available for the affected LGAs, however previous entomological surveys conducted in 2018/2019 during outbreaks in settings of similar climate and vegetation in Ebonyi, Bauchi, Edo, Kogi and Kwara identified adult\u00a0Aedes\u00a0spp. mosquitos However, the region is entering the dry season (November to March) and vector densities are expected to be lower. The vector,\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0is only moderately affected by drier conditions and remains active, and therefore sustained vector-borne transmission within human populations cannot be ruled out.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV), measles, monkeypox, Lassa fever and cholera outbreaks as well as humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. At present, the Yellow Fever outbreaks are considered high risk at national level, low at regional and global levels.Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections can reduce mortality and is recommended.Yellow fever is endemic in Nigeria, a priority country for the EYE strategy. Accelerated phased YF PMVCs are planned to cover the entire country by 2024. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers from 9 months of age going to Nigeria. Nigeria requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for all travellers aged 9 months or over as a condition of entry.Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and are instructed to seek rapid medical advice when presenting signs. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 1 July 2020 and are available on the WHO International Travel and Health website (see below).WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria based on the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Nigeria", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-draft", "date_of_publication": "2020-11-18", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "On 18 November 2020, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the\u00a0end of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province. The declaration was made in accordance with\u00a0WHO recommendations, 42 days after the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time on 6 October 2020 in Makanza Health Zone, Equateur Province.This outbreak was declared on 1 June 2020 following investigations and laboratory confirmation of EVD in samples taken after four deaths reported in Mbandaka Health Zone. Further investigations identified cases with dates of symptom onset from May to September 2020 in 41 health areas across 13 health zones, namely Bikoro, Bolenge, Bolomba, Bomongo, Iboko, Ingende, Lilanga Bobangi, Lolanga Mampoko, Lotumbe, Makanza, Mbandaka, Monieka and Wangata Health Zones.This was the 11th EVD outbreak reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the virus was first identified in 1976, and the second in Equateur Province. Two genetically distinct Ebola Zaire viruses were in circulation during this outbreak, based on available information. Four cases that were linked through one chain of transmission in Iboko Health Zone were infected with the same Ebola virus as the 2018 outbreak in Equateur Province, and a new Ebola Zaire virus that had emerged in 2020 was identified in all the other cases.The outbreak response was led by the Ministry of Health with support from WHO and partners. Priorities during this response included strengthening diagnostic capabilities, infection prevention and control in health facilities and communities, ring vaccination around confirmed and probable cases and vaccination of frontline workers, delivering care and monoclonal antibody treatment for patients, supporting safe and dignified burials, risk communication and community engagement and establishment of 52 points of entry or points of control to screen population movements.Response efforts were mounted in the context of significant logistical challenges. For example, cellular coverage for mobile phones was severely constrained and limitations in ground transportation necessitated aerial or riverine transport, which hampered communication among surveillance teams. This complicated the transportation and testing of quality laboratory samples, and delayed deployment of technical experts to affected areas.Disease surveillance was consistently challenged by low levels of reported alerts, particularly among deaths. Overall, 67% of confirmed cases were not identified as known contacts at the time of detection, highlighting the challenges of performing rigorous case investigation and the potential for undetected transmission. Moreover, the geographical distribution and epidemiological links between cases have not yet been well-understood. Despite these challenges, multi-sectoral coordination was strengthened, and surveillance and investigation activities were enhanced. No new confirmed cases have been reported since 28 September 2020.From 1 June to 18 November 2020, a total of 130 EVD cases including 119 confirmed and 11 probable cases were reported from 13 health zones. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 45% (n=58) were female and 23% (n=30) were children aged less than 18 years. There were 55 deaths recorded (overall proportion of deaths among reported cases was 42%), 29% (34/119) of cases died outside Ebola treatment centres, and 75 cases recovered from EVD. Over the course of the outbreak, more than 26 000 contacts of cases were registered in Equateur Province.However, the risk of re-emergence of EVD remains, even after human-to-human transmission of EVD has been interrupted in Equateur Province. Ebola Zaire virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region, and it can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months, which in rare events may result in secondary transmission. Therefore, cases of EVD may continue to be reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A robust and coordinated surveillance system must be maintained to rapidly detect, isolate, test and provide care for new suspected cases, and operations must continue to care for people who have recovered from EVD.Under the longer-term plan that is currently in development, enhanced surveillance, a programme for long-term care of Ebola survivors and other response mechanisms remain in place after the end of the outbreak. These activities will help maintain heightened vigilance and contribute to strengthening a resilient health care system.In response to this EVD outbreak, from 1 June 2020 to 18 November 2020:On 18 November 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of human-to-human transmission of EVD over in Equateur Province\u00a0after two maximum incubation periods (42 days) had elapsed since the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time\u00a0on 6 October 2020. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of EVD because alert rates have remained sub-optimal in all affected and non-affected health zones, including death alerts throughout the outbreak, and cases may have gone undetected. In addition, Ebola virus is enzootic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months which, in rare events, may result in secondary transmission.There are ongoing challenges for surveillance, including access to affected areas and community mistrust toward authorities and outbreak responders. Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys and apes:To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids:To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends establishing an EVD survivors care programme to provide medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two negative consecutive tests).

The case is a one-year-old female who developed symptoms of fever, productive cough, difficulty breathing and runny nose on 13 October 2020. She was hospitalized for her illness on 16 October and discharged on 19 October. As part of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance, a specimen was collected on the date of hospitalization and confirmed to be positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) on 28 October by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology (NCLE).Among the close contacts of the patient, one contact developed fever and cough after the onset of illness in the case. Specimens collected from all household contacts, including the symptomatic contact, were negative for influenza A viruses.Upon further investigation, there were domestic poultry at the residence. There was no travel history of the family 14 days prior to symptom onset in the case.This is the third human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from Lao PDR since 2005; two cases including two deaths were reported in 2007.The government of Lao PDR has taken the following monitoring, prevention and control measures as detailed in the Joint National Preparedness and Contingency Plan for Avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) for Lao PDR:To date, 862 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported to WHO since 2003, including three from Lao PDR. Nearly all cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1) virus-contaminated environments. Human infection can cause severe disease and has reportedly high mortality rate. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.Currently available epidemiologic and virologic evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. Thorough investigation of every human infection with a un-subtypeable influenza A virus is essential.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such viruses and related information for further characterization and risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report\u00a0.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and potentially contaminated environments and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Districts affected include Tidjikja and Moudj\u00e9ria (Tagant region), Guerou (Assaba region) and Chinguetty (Adrar region). Laboratory confirmation of RVF infection was performed using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP) in Nouakchott. The age of infected patients varied between 16 and 70 years old and included one woman and seven men. All seven deaths occurred among hospitalised patients with fever and haemorrhagic syndrome (petechia, gingivorrhagia) and vomiting.Between 4 September and 7 November 2020, a total of 214 people were sampled and their samples have been sent to the INRSP for laboratory testing with a total of 75 testing positive for RVF (RT-PCR and serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The Tagant region is the most affected (38/75, 51%) with principal hotspot districts being Tidjikja and Moudjeria. Thus far a total of 25 deaths have been reported from this outbreak.Outbreaks in animals have also been confirmed in the regions of Assaba, Tagant, Brakna, Trarza, Hodh El Gharbi and Hodh El Chargui. The results of 557 animal samples taken as of 15 October 2020 showed that 74 camels, 52 small ruminants and 12 cattle were positive for Rift Valley Fever.Since the beginning of the outbreak, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health to respond to the current outbreak and monitor the evolution of the epidemiological situation.WHO is supporting the following public health activities being implemented to respond to the outbreak:Joint field missions by FAO, OIE and WHO experts are planned to support MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development in the prevention and control of RVF outbreaks, in particular with regards to laboratory capacities, surveillance and risk communication to various populations at risk, and in other aspects related to the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept.Since the beginning of the outbreak, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health to respond to the current outbreak and monitor the evolution of the epidemiological situation.WHO is supporting the following public health activities being implemented to respond to the outbreak:Joint field missions by FAO, OIE and WHO experts are planned to support MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development in the prevention and control of RVF outbreaks, in particular with regards to laboratory capacities, surveillance and risk communication to various populations at risk, and in other aspects related to the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept.Rift Valley Fever is an environmentally-driven mosquito-borne zoonosis that primarily affects domestic animals (including cattle, sheep, camels and goats). Human cases often occur in proximity to outbreaks in livestock in an environment favourable for mosquito vectors to transmit the virus locally. Most human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Care must be taken when handling sick animals or human patients, their products and laboratory samples. Raising awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection as well as other protective measures such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites is the key to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:As outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential in providing early warning for animal and public health authorities. Routine animal immunization in endemic areas can prevent RVF epizootics. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as it may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Therefore, public education, livestock quarantine, and slaughter bans are perhaps the most effective measures against disease spread during the pre-outbreak and outbreak phasesWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Mauritania or the affected area based on the current information available on this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Mauritania", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON297", "date_of_publication": "2020-11-06", "headline": "COVID-19 - Denmark", "main_text": "Since June 2020, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks, including 12 cases with a unique variant, reported on 5 November. All 12 cases were identified in September 2020 in North Jutland, Denmark. The cases ranged in age from 7 to 79 years, and eight had a link to the mink farming industry and four cases were from the local community.Initial observations suggest that the clinical presentation, severity and transmission among those infected are similar to that of other circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses. However, this variant, referred to as the \"cluster 5\" variant, had a combination of mutations, or changes that have not been previously observed. The implications of the identified changes in this variant are not yet well understood. Preliminary findings indicate that this particular mink-associated variant identified in both minks and the 12 human cases has moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Further scientific and laboratory-based studies are required to verify preliminary findings reported and to understand any potential implications of this finding in terms of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in development. In the meantime, actions are being taken by Danish authorities to limit the further spread of this variant of the virus among mink and human populations.SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, was first identified in humans in December 2019. As of 6 November, it has affected more than 48 million people causing over 1.2 million deaths worldwide. Although the virus is believed to be ancestrally linked to bats, the virus origin and intermediate host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.Available evidence suggests that the virus is predominantly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and close contact, but there are also examples of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals that have been in contact with infected humans, such as minks, dogs, domestic cats, lions and tigers, have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Minks were infected following exposure from infected humans. Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans. People can then transmit this virus within the human population. Additionally, spill-back (human to mink transmission) can occur. It remains a concern when any animal virus spills in to the human population, or when an animal population could contribute to amplifying and spreading a virus affecting humans. As viruses move between human and animal populations, genetic modifications in the virus can occur. These changes can be identified through whole genome sequencing, and when found, experiments can study the possible implications of these changes on the disease in humans.To date, six countries, namely Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the United States of America have reported SARS-CoV-2 in farmed minks to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).Danish authorities have announced the following planned or ongoing public health actions:All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time. SARS-CoV-2 strains infecting minks, which are subsequently transmitted to humans, may have acquired unique combinations of mutations. In order to fully understand the impact of specific mutations, advanced laboratory studies are required. These investigations take time and are done in close collaboration between different research groups.The recent findings reported by the Danish Public Health Authority (Statens Serum Institut) in Denmark related to the novel variant of SARS-CoV-2 identified in humans need to be confirmed and further evaluated to better understand any potential implications in terms of transmission, clinical presentation, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development.Furthermore, detailed analyses and scientific studies are needed to better understand the reported mutations. The sharing of full genome sequences of human and animal strains will continue to facilitate detailed analyses by partners. Members of the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group are working with Danish scientists to better understand the available results and collaborate on further studies. Further scientific and laboratory-based studies will be undertaken to understand the implications of these viruses in terms of available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in development.Actions taken by the Danish authorities will limit continued spread of mink-associated variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark, and in particular have been implemented to contain the unique variant reported to WHO. These actions include restricting movement of people, culling animals, widespread testing of people living in affected areas and increased genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses across the country.This event highlights the important role that farmed mink populations can play in the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the critical role of strong surveillance, sampling and sequencing SARS-CoV-2, especially around areas where such animal reservoirs are identified.The preliminary findings by Denmark are globally relevant and WHO recognises the importance of sharing epidemiological, virological and full genome sequence information with other countries and research teams, including through open-source platforms.WHO advises further virological studies should be conducted to understand the specific mutations described by Denmark and to further investigate any epidemiological changes in function of the virus in terms of its transmissibility and the severity of disease it causes. WHO advises all countries to increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible and sharing the sequence data internationally.WHO advises all countries to enhance surveillance for COVID-19 at the animal-human interface where susceptible animal reservoirs are identified, including mink farms.WHO also reminds countries to strengthen farming biosafety and biosecurity measures around known animal reservoirs in order to limit the risk of zoonotic events associated with SARS-CoV-2. This includes infection prevention and control measures for animal workers, farm visitors and those who may be involved in animal husbandry or culling.The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections are as follows:WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions for Denmark based on the information currently available on this event. WHO has issued guidance for\u00a0Public health considerations while resuming international travel, recommending a thorough risk assessment, taking into account country context, the local epidemiology and transmission patterns, the national health and social measures to control the outbreak, and the capacities of health systems in both departure and destination countries, including at points of entry. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travellers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators, and at points of entry.", "reports": {"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Denmark", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/mayaro-virus-disease---french-guiana-france", "date_of_publication": "2020-10-24", "headline": "Mayaro virus disease - French Guiana", "main_text": "On 13 October 2020, the French health authorities officially reported 13 laboratory-confirmed cases of Mayaro fever in French Guiana, France.In September 2020, the Institut Pasteur de la Guyane (IPG) (member of the French National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses) identified two cases of Mayaro virus infection (MAYV) confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one probable case found positive for Mayaro antibodies. The case-patients presented dengue-like symptoms and joint pains, and tested negative for dengue by RT-PCR.This unexpected diagnosis led to a further retrospective search for additional cases of Mayaro fever among patients with dengue-like symptoms who tested negative for dengue. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed on samples collected between 15 July and 15 September, at laboratories mainly located in Cayenne area. These blood samples were collected from patients with dengue-like symptoms , who had tested negative for dengue within five days after the onset of symptoms. In total (including the first detections and retrospective search) IPG identified 11 cases of Mayaro fever by RT-PCR out of 79 samples tested. These cases were reported on 21 September 2020.On 2 October and 8 October 2020, two additional confirmed cases of Mayaro fever were reported by the Institute Pasteur de la Guyane in Cayenne, leading to a total of 13 confirmed cases among 97 tested samples between 15 July and early October. The onset of symptoms for the 13 confirmed cases ranged from 18 July to 29 September 2020. Of the 13 confirmed cases, 11 lived in the urban coastal area including nine from Cayenne area (Cayenne: 1, R\u00e9mire: 4, Matoury: 4), one from Kourou, and one from Montsinery-Tonnegrande. Only two cases lived in a rural/sylvatic area, both in Roura (including one in the village of Cacao, located further in the interior). The age of these cases ranged between 11 to 68 years old (median = 40 years old) and the male to female sex ratio was 1.2:1.Mayaro virus (MAYV) has been known to circulate in French Guiana since 1998, but the number of RT-PCR detections of MAYV by IPG between 2017 and 2019 added up to between 1 to 3 confirmed cases annually, detected from 150 to over 600 samples tested every year. As per the testing criteria for MAYV, blood samples were collected within 5 days of the onset of dengue-like symptoms and found negative for dengue virus.Detection of 13 confirmed cases within less than 3 months is thus unusual. Furthermore, MAYV is mainly transmitted through a sylvatic cycle and transmission in urban settings has been sparsely described. It is therefore atypical that 11 out of 13 (85%) identified cases of Mayaro fever resided in an urban area.MAYV vector (Haemagogus\u00a0species mosquitoes) is also the vector of the sylvatic cycle of yellow fever virus and is present in wild or rural habitats of the region of the Americas and the Caribbean. MAYV has been isolated from other genera of mosquitoes, including\u00a0Culex,Mansonia,\u00a0Aedes,\u00a0Psorophora, and\u00a0Sabethes.Epidemiological investigation is ongoing in particular to document the travel history of the cases and to determine whether the infections were contracted in forest areas or if the transmission through an urban cycle may be suspected.Public health measures that are planned or ongoing include the following:MAYV was isolated for the first time in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954. However, a retrospective study showed evidence of infection by MAYV in sera collected during the construction of channels in Panama and Colombia between 1904 and 1914. Since then, cases have been reported in Central America and South America, particularly in the regions around the Amazon basin with some cases exported by travelers reported in the academic literature. These cases impacted individuals from Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and unidentified parts of North America.Although some studies suggest MAYV transmission in urban areas, most of the outbreaks described in the last decade in the Americas were reported among residents of rural communities in the Amazon region of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Venezuela. Most human cases occurred among persons who work or reside in tropical rainforests. The reservoir for MAYV is unknown, but some studies have reported virus isolation or high levels of antibodies in host vertebrates, such as non-human primates.Changes in the natural environment, deforestation, urbanization, and mining result in increased interactions between host and vector populations and demonstrates the potential of MAYV to emerge in new areas and re-emerge in existing areas.Mayaro fever is a mosquito borne zoonosis caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV), an arbovirus of the Alphavirus genus, Togavirus family. MAYV transmission is mainly maintained through the sylvatic cycle that involves non-human primates and\u00a0Haemagogus\u00a0mosquitoes. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments inhabited by these vectors.At the initial stage, Mayaro fever presents as a non-specific clinical picture like other arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, Zika). The incubation period ranges between 1 to 12 days. The disease is self-limiting, with a duration from 3 to 5 days, with persistence of arthralgia that can remain for weeks or months; however as with others Alphavirus infections, MAYV can produce severe complications, such as intermittent fever, neurological complications, myocarditis, and even death.Due to the generic nature of the symptoms of arboviruses, misdiagnosis can occur. Cases of MAYV may be going undetected due to a lack of awareness among the medical community.Diagnostic testing for MAYV is not widely available, and little is known of MAYV outside of endemic areas. Imported cases may be getting clinically misdiagnosed as dengue, Zika, Chikungunya. In endemic regions coinfection with other arboviral diseases may also misguide the diagnosis of MAYV.The risk of international spread appears to be small at this stage but cannot be excluded if an urban transmission cycle is shown to have been established.In the urban coastal area around Cayenne, there is a risk of additional cases if the transmission occurred in the peri-urban forest. The most likely places of infection are still under investigation.The risk of spread at national level cannot be excluded as the virus circulates over a larger area, beyond Cayenne and its surroundings. Investigations are currently ongoing to determine the affected areas.With the global circulation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to healthcare access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and healthcare workers, and decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Another aspect to be taken into consideration in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples due the over-demand in processing COVID-19 samples, in addition to the ongoing epidemic of dengue and localized outbreak of Oropouche virus (for more information, please see the\u00a0DON published on 13 October). Furthermore, due to non-availability of commercial diagnostic kits, Mayaro diagnostic capacity solely rests on the national reference laboratory. As of 18 October 2020, French Guiana has reported 10 268 COVID-19 cases and 69 deaths.Given the broad distribution of the main vector implicated in transmission in the rural areas of the Region and in light of the recent detection of Mayaro fever cases in new geographic areas, WHO encourages Member States to implement actions for detecting cases and keeping healthcare professionals informed to therefore consider Mayaro fever as part of the differential diagnosis for other arboviruses such as chikungunya, dengue, Oropouche, yellow fever and Zika. Considering the similar clinical presentation for Mayaro fever with that of other arboviruses, such as dengue, chikungunya, Oropouche, yellow fever, and zika, surveillance for Mayaro fever could be integrated with existing arbovirus surveillance.Surveillance, diagnosis of MAYV, and vector control are the three main pillars in terms of prevention of the disease. The prevention of Mayaro is contingent on the suppression of mosquito bites and, consequently, of human\u2013vector contact. In the case of\u00a0Haemagogus\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes\u00a0vectors, whose peak activity coincides at the beginning or the end of the day, personal protection measures should be encouraged and promoted. The suppression of mosquito breeding sites through source reduction can be reinforced by community engagement and social mobilization.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade for French Guiana based on available information on this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Mayaro virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "French Guiana", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/oropouche-virus-disease---french-guiana-france", "date_of_publication": "2020-10-13", "headline": "Oropouche virus disease - French Guiana", "main_text": "On 30 September 2020, the French Guiana Regional Health Agency (ARS) reported the first detection of Oropouche virus (OROV) in French Guiana. On 22 September 2020 the Pasteur Institute in Cayenne (a member of the French National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses) notified the France IHR National Focal Point of seven laboratory-confirmed cases of Oropouche virus infection in the village of Sa\u00fcl. These cases were identified following clinical investigations of an unusually high number of dengue-like illnesses in the village. Between 11 August and 25 September, there were 37 clinically-compatible cases of Oropouche virus disease identified in Sa\u00fcl. The results of serology for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika were negative, and seven of nine cases tested positive for OROV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Among the 37 clinically-compatible cases, most cases are male (60%) and the median age is 36 years (range 3-82 years). The most represented age range is 15 to 54-years-old (19 cases) followed by 0 to 14-years-old (10 cases). A peak of cases was observed in mid-September however, the outbreak investigation remains ongoing.The village of Sa\u00fcl is remote and is surrounded by Amazonian rainforest. The village can only be reached via the Sa\u00fcl Airport and is approximately a 45-minute flight from Cayenne.It is a popular destination for hiking and the official population of Sa\u00fcl is 150 persons. However, due to a drastic reduction in the frequency of flights to and from Sa\u00fcl during the COVID-19 pandemic, the population living in Sa\u00fcl during August-September was estimated to be between 50 to 80 persons. Therefore, given the 37 clinically compatible cases, the attack rate of OROV, in this village could be as high as 70%. No cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Sa\u00fcl thus far.Public health measures that are planned or are ongoing include the following:This is the first detection of Oropouche virus in French Guiana. Therefore, the population is highly susceptible. To date, there is no evidence of direct human-to-human Oropouche virus transmission. Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have been reported in other countries within the Region of the Americas, and therefore the competent vector, the\u00a0Culicoides paraensis\u00a0midge is present in the region, as is\u00a0Culex quinquefasciatus\u00a0which can also be a vector. However, the extent to which these vectors are present in French Guiana needs to be further established. Given the geographical distribution of the other competent vectors in the Region of the Americas, cases may be identified in other countries. The WHO Regional Office for the Americas and the Pan-American Health Organization continue to monitor the epidemiological situation based on the latest available information.With the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to health care access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers and decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.Another aspect to consider given the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples for arboviruses due the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples and the absence of commercial diagnostic kits. As of 12 October, French Guiana reports 10 144 cases of COVID-19 and 69 deaths.Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common vector-borne diseases in the region of the Americas (e.g., malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever). WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel for all international travelers nine months of age going to French Guiana. French Guiana requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travelers over one (1) year of age.The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for OROV infection. Prevention strategies are based on control or eradication measures for the arthropod vectors and personal protection measures. Vector control measures rely on reducing midge populations through the eradication of breeding sites, including good agricultural practices. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities. Personal protection measures rely on prevention of midge biting using mechanical barriers (mosquito nets), insect repellant devices, repellent-treated clothing and anti-mosquito repellents. Chemical insecticides such as deltamethrin and N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) have demonstrated to be effective in controlling\u00a0Culicoides\u00a0and\u00a0Culex\u00a0species.Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV), a single-stranded RNA virus that is part of the\u00a0Peribunyaviridae\u00a0family, that has been found to circulate in Central and South America and the Caribbean. It is suspected that viral circulation includes both epidemic and sylvatic cycles. In the sylvatic cycle, primates, sloths, and perhaps birds are the vertebrate hosts, although a definitive arthropod vector has not been identified. In the epidemic cycle, humans are the amplifying host and OROV is transmitted primarily through the bite of the\u00a0Culicoides paraensis\u00a0midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human-to-human has been documented. Oropouche fever causes dengue-like symptoms, with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, rash, joint pain, and vomiting. Illness typically lasts 3\u20136 days. A brief recurrence of symptoms may occur in up to 60% of cases. Aseptic meningitis is an uncommon complication. In the Americas, outbreaks of OROV have been reported in rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, and now in French Guiana.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Oropouche virus disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "French Guiana", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/monkeypox-democratic-republic-of-the-congo", "date_of_publication": "2020-10-01", "headline": "Monkeypox - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "From 1 January through 13 September 2020, a total of 4,594 suspected cases of monkeypox, including 171 deaths (case fatality ratio 3.7%), have been reported in 127 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first epidemic peak was observed at the beginning of March 2020 (epi week 10), with 136 cases reported weekly (Figure1). From 1 January through 7 August, the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) received 80 samples from suspected cases of monkeypox, of which 39 samples were confirmed positive by polymerase chain reaction. Four out of the 80 specimens were skin lesions (crusts/vesicles), the remaining samples were blood. There is no further information at this time regarding the outcome of these 80 patients whose samples were tested. Confirmatory testing remains ongoing.During the same period in 2019, 3,794 suspected cases and 73 deaths (CFR 1.9%) were reported in 120 health zones from 16 provinces while a total of 2,850 suspected cases (CFR 2.1%) were reported in 2018.The provinces reporting the highest number of suspected cases include Sankuru with 973 (21.2%) suspected cases, Mai-Ndombe with 964 (21%) suspected cases, Equateur with 586 (12.8%) suspected cases, Tshuapa with 520 (11.3%) suspected cases and Mongala with 518 (11.3%) suspected cases (Figure 2). From 1 January to 13 September, Kwilu province is reporting the highest case fatality ratio of 16.7% (1 death/6 suspected cases), followed by Tshopo 8.1% (17 deaths/211 suspected cases), and Mai-Ndombe 7.8% (75 deaths/964 suspected cases).Active outbreaks in Mai-Ndombe province (located south of Equateur province, in the north west side of the country) have been reported since January 2020. The outbreak in Inongo health zone (Mai-Ndombe province) is one of the most concerning outbreaks where one-fourth of its territory is affected. This outbreak has been ongoing since June 2020, comprising 65% of the total number of suspected cases with an estimated case fatality ratio of 10%. Moreover, Inongo health zone borders Bikoro health zone (Equateur province); Equateur province is the location of the current Ebola outbreak, and now also a monkeypox outbreak.Within the Democratic Republic of the Congo, majority of suspected cases (58%) are above the age of five; however, the case fatality ratio for children under the age of five is higher at 4.2% (80 deaths/1,907 suspected cases) as compared to 3.4% in cases over the age of five (91 deaths/2,687 suspected cases).Source: Integrated Disease Surveillance (IDS) Report for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Epidemiological Week 37, 2020Monkeypox cases were reported in health zones which are also experiencing multiple disease outbreaks, including measles, polio due to cVDPV, malaria, cholera, and COVID-19, in addition to an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in Equateur Province which continues to experience armed conflict and violence. The security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains unstable, further disrupting surveillance efforts and response activities. Affected regions for this outbreak continue to experience armed conflict and population displacements.Potential exposure might be linked to proximity to the forest with many possible animal reservoirs, including for hunting activities.With global circulation of the virus causing COVID-19 and ongoing insecurity in the region, there is a risk of disruption of access to health care due to the COVID-19 related burden on the health system. As of 16 September 2020, a total of 10,401 cases of COVID-19 including 267 deaths were reported in the DRC.WHO is working with national authorities to obtain more information about cases and laboratory capacity. Investigation and confirmation of suspected cases will help to further understand the range of the virus in DRC.Technical support is being provided to the Ministry of Health to rapidly develop and implement a comprehensive response plan to strengthen surveillance at national and local levels, including further outbreak investigation and response activities.One major challenge to the current emergency includes inadequate funding to respond to the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country. Weaknesses of surveillance and laboratories, along with a high number of refugees crossing the border from Kasai province into Angola, could all contribute to further spread of the outbreak.The support of partners such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) will be critical for the control of this outbreak.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family, the same group of viruses as smallpox.There are two distinct clades of monkeypox virus, the Congo Basin clade and the West African clade. Monkeypox due to the Congo Basin clade virus has seen reported mortality of up to 10% of cases, whereas the West African clade usually displays fatal outcomes in less than 1% of cases. HIV infection appears to increase the risk of death in people infected with monkeypox virus.The animal reservoir remains unknown. However, evidence suggests that native African rodents may be potential sources. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14-21 days. Severe cases occur more commonly among children and immunocompromised population, particularly persons with HIV, and are related to the extent of virus exposure, patient health status and severity of complications. The case fatality ratio has varied between epidemics but has been between 1% and 10% in documented events. There is no specific treatment licensed for monkeypox and a recently approved vaccine is not yet widely available for the public sector.Since identification of the first human case of monkeypox in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then known as Zaire) in a 9-month-old boy, and until the year 1986, 95% of cases worldwide were reported in the DRC. Cases of monkeypox have also been reported from other African countries - Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. In 2003, an outbreak occurred in the United States of America following the importation of infected animals. Single imported cases were identified in Israel and the United Kingdom in 2018, and in Singapore in 2019, all following diagnosis in travelers from Nigeria. In the UK, a secondary case was confirmed in a health worker.With the eradication of smallpox and the subsequent cessation of routine smallpox vaccination, human monkeypox has appeared with increasing frequency in unvaccinated populations.The risk is assessed as high at national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.Several orthopoxviruses, and specifically the monkeypox virus, circulate in wildlife populations and sporadically spill over to affect human beings. Reducing contacts with and reliance on wildlife will enhance disease prevention efforts for zoonoses that affect wildlife, including monkeypox.Strengthening cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries (Republic of Congo, DRC and Central African Republic) including sharing of data and information is needed.Residents and travelers to endemic areas / countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor monkeypox virus (rodents, marsupials, primates) and should refrain from eating or handling bush meat. The importance of hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized. Hand washing stations and infection control initiatives such as use of disinfectants should be put in place in hospital settings. Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history.Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness among health care providers are essential to preventing secondary cases and effective management of monkeypox outbreaks. Infection control in health facilities is crucial. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions.Samples taken from people and animals with suspected monkeypox virus infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories. Confirmation of monkeypox depends on the type and quality of the specimen and the type of laboratory test. Thus, specimens should be packaged and shipped in accordance with national and international requirements. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test given its accuracy and sensitivity. For this, optimal diagnostic samples for monkeypox are from skin lesions - the roof or fluid from vesicles and pustules, and dry crusts. PCR blood tests are often inconclusive because of the short duration of viremia relative to the timing of specimen collection after symptoms begin. Serology is not indicated to detect acute infection. For these reasons, blood should not be routinely collected from patients unless part of research or a wider outbreak investigation which includes identifying previous cases.Vaccinia vaccine used during the smallpox eradication program was also protective against monkeypox. Some countries and WHO maintain emergency stockpiles of smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine. A new safer third generation vaccinia vaccine (known as modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine) approved in 2019 for prevention of monkeypox is not yet widely available for the public sector. Antiviral agents are also being developed.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to and trade with Democratic Republic of the Congo based on available information at this point in time.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/chikungunya-chad", "date_of_publication": "2020-09-24", "headline": "Disease outbreak news - Chad", "main_text": "From July through 20 September 2020, a total of 27 540 cases were reported in three provinces, distributed as follows: 24 302 cases in the health district of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, 3237 cases in the health district of Biltine, and one case in the health district of Abdi. One death has been reported to date in district of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9. After a few hours of treatment in a health facility, patients continue with outpatient treatment. The most affected age group are those aged 15 years and over. More than three-quarters of cases developed a high fever, headache, and joint pain, while one-third developed maculopapular rashes.In July 2020 health authorities were alerted to the occurrence of a disease-causing high fever, headache, intense and disabling joint pain, and sometimes associated with vomiting. It was eventually determined to be the chikungunya virus once it was confirmed in a 63-year-old female farmer. She had no reported travel outside of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 district. A total of 13 samples from Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 district, Ouaddai Province, were sent for analysis at the N'Djamena mobile laboratory on 12 August 2020 and 11 samples tested positive for chikungunya virus.The test results were corroborated by the Pasteur laboratory in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon (a WHO reference laboratory), with five samples sent for quality control found positive for chikungunya virus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for other arboviruses (dengue and Zika), but not for the O'nyong-nyong virus or the yellow fever virus.Regarding the vectors and environmental context,\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes, which transmit the disease, are found in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 district. Dry season should begin in October with a hot semi-arid climate less favourable for mosquitoes. Other entomological studies are underway in the provinces of Wadi-Fira and Sila to determine the presence of the vector responsible for the disease.Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 is the fourth largest city in Chad and is the hub for the delivery of humanitarian assistance for approximately 240 000 Darfurian refugees living in 12 camps east of the town, in the border region of Sudan.Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness.There is no specific antiviral treatment or commercially available vaccine for chikungunya. Chikungunya virus can cause large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating, and therefore potentially leading to the overburdening of the health care sector. The risk at national level is moderate due to the high number of cases reported in a short period of time, the presence of\u00a0Aedes\u00a0vectors in the country, and the fact that this is the first outbreak in the country. It has been demonstrated in the past in other parts of the world that the virus has a strong epidemic potential in the regions where the population is naive to chikungunya virus. As the dry season is approaching in early October with a hot semi-arid climate less favourable for mosquito proliferation, the risk at regional and global levels is lower. With the added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system and health workers, there is a risk of disruption to health care access. There may also be decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. In the current context, the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples (due to the high demand in processing COVID-19 samples) and a further increase in the number of cases likely to occur, this could potentially lead to a significant strain on health services. In Chad, from 19 March through 16 September 2020, there have been 1 090 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 81 deaths.Clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester). Sleep under a mosquito bed net (during day time) and use air conditioning or window screens to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.The\u00a0Aedes albopictus\u00a0species thrives in a wide range of water-filled containers, including tree-holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as unused vehicle tires, saucers beneath plant pots, rain water barrels, cisterns and catch basins.\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0also breeds in the artificial water holding containers in and around houses and places of work. Prevention and control rely heavily on reducing the number of these natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities, strengthening entomological monitoring to assess impact of control measures and implementation of additional control as and when needed. During outbreaks, indoor spraying with insecticides may be used to kill flying mosquitoes along with source reduction measures and larvicides to kill the immature larvae. National blood services/authorities should monitor epidemiological information and strengthen haemovigilance to identify any potential transfusion-transmission of chikungunya virus. Appropriate safety precautions in line with measures taken to prevent other transfusion-transmitted mosquito-borne viruses should be taken based on the epidemiological situation and risk assessment1.Further activities include: the dissemination of chikungunya clinical guidelines, including key messages; updated training for clinicians of the clinical diagnosis of chikungunya; case reporting; and case management during the acute phase, sub-acute, chronic phase, and when there are complications. Ensuring free access to treatments and avoiding self-medication are also important actions.1\u00a0http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/publications/guide_selection_assessing_suitability.pdf2\u00a0Int. J.

In the past 21 days (12 August \u2013 1 September 2020), 24 confirmed cases have been reported in 15 health areas across eight health zones. To date, three healthcare workers have been affected, making up 3% of all cases. In addition, 48 people have recovered from EVD to date.The Ministry of Health is leading the response in affected health zones with the support of WHO and partners. Response priorities include strengthening surveillance and contact tracing, enhancing laboratory capacity, implementing adequate clinical management of suspect and confirmed cases, continuing ring vaccination around confirmed cases, vaccinating frontline workers, providing safe and dignified burials, supporting infection prevention and control in health facilities, and engaging with affected communities.Key response measures to date include:A lack of funding is constraining the ability of WHO and partners to respond, as is a lack of sufficient human resources. Scaling-up response activities has been further hampered by ongoing strikes among locally-based response teams. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health and partners to address this challenge.WHO has not received adequate EVD funding since the start of 2020, and is currently using its emergency funds to support epidemiological and public health interventions. Access to financial and human resources are further challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak which is putting an additional burden on the national health system. The risk of disruption to surveillance and routine public health activities due to COVID-19 might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly contain re-emergence of these EVD cases. As of 29 August 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 1044 COVID-19 cases and 258 deaths.In addition, response teams are currently operating in a logistically challenging environment, with many of the affected areas only accessible by boat or helicopter and with limited telecommunications capacity. Further challenges include:Investigations are ongoing in recently affected health zones to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance should be maintained.On 1 September 2020, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from moderate to high at the regional level, while the risk level remained high at the national level and low at the global level.

Both children received the their last bOPV ( type 1 & 3) dose in 2019. Initial investigation indicates these cases are linked to cVDPV2s from the CHA-NDJ-1 emergence group which was first detected in October 2019 and is currently circulating in Chad and Cameroon. Eleven additional suspected cases have also been confirmed as cVDPV2 and field investigation reports are being consolidated. These cases are in the following states \u2013 Red Sea, West Darfur, East Darfur, White Nile, River Nile and Gezira. Hence, between 9 August and 26 August 2020, there have been a total of 13 cVDPV2 cases reported. Additionally, three cVDPV2-positive environmental samples from Soba, Elgoz and Hawasha sites from Khartoum were detected (samples collected on 29 March 2020). Sequencing of viruses isolated in Sudan so far reflects that the viruses are related with viruses reported earlier in neighboring Chad from where there were multiple separate introductions into Sudan from Chad. There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad.Following the detection of cVDPV2 in the country, the following response activities are being planned and/or implemented:It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for Acuter Flaccid Paralysis in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from polio-affected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travelers who live or visited the country for four weeks or longer. Countries infected by cVDPV2 should encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Sudan", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON288", "date_of_publication": "2020-08-01", "headline": "Yellow Fever - French Guiana", "main_text": "On 23 July 2020, the France IHR National Focal Point reported a confirmed autochthonous (locally acquired) case of yellow fever in a 14-year-old male in French Guiana. On 17 July 2020, the case was laboratory confirmed at the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses, Institute Pasteur Cayenne.The case-patient had severe disability, and developed dengue-like symptoms on 12 July. On 16 July, he was hospitalized in an intensive care unit in Cayenne, French Guiana, with consciousness disorders and acute liver failure, and died on 19 July.The case-patient\u2019s vaccination history at Mother and Child Welfare Center showed evidence of vaccination for yellow fever at the age of 18 months, however, this was not confirmed by his immunization booklet. In addition, there was no evidence of recommended booster dose as recommended in French Guiana for children between 6 and 10 years of age who were vaccinated before 2 years of age. An initial serology carried out by the Institute Pasteur Cayenne showed absence of detectable antibodies.The case-patient lived in the village of Cayod\u00e9, commune of Maripasoula in French Guiana, with no history of travel outside of the Village. The village of Cayod\u00e9 is located in the heart of the Amazonian forest, on the riverside, 1-2 hours by pirogue from the town of Maripasoula. According to preliminary results of the epidemiological investigation, the probable place of infection is Maripasoula, Haut-Maroni in French GuianaA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was conducted at French National Reference Centre for arboviruses, Institute Pasteur Cayenne and was positive for both yellow fever and COVID-19.Vaccination coverage in the Amerindian country of Upper Maroni is estimated to be between 95 and 100% (estimated at 97.9% in the commune of Maripasoula).1The epidemiological investigations are nearly complete including an evaluation of the vaccination status of the inhabitants of Cayod\u00e9 and Haut Maroni, in order to find people who are either not vaccinated or have doubts about their vaccination status.Aedes aegypti\u00a0, an urban vector for yellow fever virus, is largely present in French Guiana.This is the third confirmed case of yellow fever diagnosed since 2017, and the first documented case of co-infection with COVID 19 and yellow fever in French Guiana.Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unimmunized population. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is very high and expected to be protective against large-scale yellow fever outbreaks; however, the coverage in some specific populations (especially from the Amazonian area) could be suboptimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections.As several countries and territories in the yellow fever endemic areas are also experiencing an intense transmission of SARS-CoV-2, further cases with co-infection may occur. Similarly, the co-circulation of yellow fever virus and SARS-CoV-2 in areas with higher bed occupancy rates in Intensive Care Units, pose an additional challenge for case management and infection and prevention control activities.With the global circulation of the virus causing COVID-19, there is a risk of disruption of access to health care due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers. The Pandemic has also led to decreased demand for health care and impacted the routine vaccination activities because of physical distancing requirements. An increase in the number of yellow fever cases or other vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) may result in increased morbidity and mortality predominantly in young infants and other vulnerable groups.Another aspect in consideration in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples due the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 25 July, French Guiana has reported 7 251 of COVID 19 cases and 41 deaths.Vaccination coverage should be improved particularly in persons living and working in the forest, who are exposed during the day to sylvatic vectors. It should also be improved in migrants and other vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to being unvaccinated and live in densely populated urban areas (with a risk of urban local transmission), or participate to illegal activities in the forest (with a risk of sporadic cases or clusters in a sylvatic context).Yellow fever is endemic in French Guiana. This case report illustrates the importance of maintaining awareness of the need for yellow fever vaccination, especially in areas with favorable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever at least 10 days prior to the travel for all international travelers to French Guiana, from nine months of age. French Guiana also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travelers over one year of age.Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travelers as a condition of entry.While countries have different vaccination schedules,\u00a0the French Guiana Regional Health Agency\u00a0recommends that children vaccinated before their second birthday require a booster dose between 6 to 10 years of age.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. When conditions permit, the EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive yellow fever activities according to\u00a0\u00a0WHO guidance.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travelers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice when presenting signs. Travelers returning to French Guiana who may be infected with yellow fever may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to French Guiana on the basis of the information available.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "French Guiana", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/plague-democratic-republic-of-the-congo", "date_of_publication": "2020-07-23", "headline": "Plague - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The health zone of Rethy in Ituri province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has seen an upsurge of plague cases since June 2020. The first case, a 12-year-old girl, reported to a local health centre on 12 June experiencing a headache, fever, cough, and an enlarged lymph node. She died on the same day and further deaths from the community due to suspected cases of plague were subsequently reported.From 11 June though 15 July, six out of 22 health areas have been affected within Rethy health zone (11 villages), with a total of 45 cases including nine deaths (case fatality rate: 20%). All nine (9) cases who died presented with signs of headache, high fever, and painful nodes; four (4) out of the nine (9) cases had cough.The health zone team carried out an investigation resulting in five positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Nine additional samples were taken and shipped to the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) laboratory in Kinshasa. Of the 45 cases reported, two showed signs of septicemic plague; all the other cases were diagnosed as having bubonic plague. According to the available information, it is likely that all three types of plague clinical presentation (bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic) are present.The distribution by sex shows 58% (26/45) are male and 93% (42/45) are greater than five years old. Of the 45 cases reported, nine including four who died, had cough among the symptoms - a sign indicating a potential progression from bubonic plague to pulmonary plague. This was specifically noticed among the deceased.Plague is endemic in Ituri province. Since the beginning of 2020, Ituri Province has reported a total of 64 plague cases and 14 deaths (CFR:21.8%) in five health zones, namely Aungba, Linga, Rethy, Aru and Kambala health zones. This compares against 10 cases and 5 deaths (lethality 50.0%) during the same period in 2019, all in a single zone.The current COVID-19 epidemic affects seven out of 26 provinces in the country. Ituri has also reported cases of COVID-191\u00a0that may further interrupt response activities due to lockdown. These are in addition to long standing public health response challenges identified in the region, including a lack of resources and insecurity. Although it has been reported that there is no significant impact of the COVID-19 context on activities taking place in this area, there is limited information available on the current access to health care. This includes whether or not there is a need for the population of Ituri to seek care in Uganda, as well as the availability of human resources, drugs, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Furthermore, the reference laboratory in Bunia, Ituri province is currently not functional, which might delay the confirmation of suspected cases and response efforts.Infection with plague can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality in humans, particularly if not identified early. Plague can exhibit in three forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic. If untreated, bubonic plague can evolve to pneumonic plague. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival and reduction of complications.Rethy health zone is endemic for plague and regularly registers cases of enzootic variants of\u00a0Yersinia pestis, in much of the wild rodent population. Its first outbreak was reported in February 2020 with cases imported from Linga health zone, based in the Godjoka health area.On the security level, there are reports of atrocities and violence linked to the militia CODECO which continues to impact the population of this territory (Djugu and its surroundings). There have been mass population displacements within Djugu and Mahagi Territories. Currently, the Rethy Health Zone has received approximately 112 714 internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom have come from the Jiba and Linga Health Zone. The growing insecurity impacts traffic flow between the villages and the willingness of the population to either stay or work in that area. There has also been a deterioration of water, hygiene and sanitation conditions in the reception areas and in the IDP sites.The early detection and reporting of the current outbreak by healthcare workers demonstrate that a functioning surveillance system is in place. Ituri province had a reference laboratory in Bunia which is no longer functional. The Institut National de la Recherce Biomedicale (INRB) laboratory based in Kinshasa/DRC has the ability to conduct laboratory testing for suspected cases. However, delays in shipping samples from Rethy to Bunia and then to Kinshasa, and delays in testing in Kinshasa INRB due to high workload and backload related to COVID-19 samples to be tested, might jeopardize the surveillance and response. Ongoing efforts are required to ensure that any other cases are promptly detected, isolated, and investigated to avoid the establishment of local transmission.The risk at national level is considered to be moderate given: the evolution of the current situation is in danger of deteriorating rapidly (case fatality rate: 20%), the notification of cases of pulmonary plague, the challenges with the surveillance system and delays between sample collection and laboratory confirmation, and the volatile security situation and the existence of other epidemics in progress in the country which prevents the setting up of a more comprehensive response. Furthermore, the health zone currently does not have enough PPE, body bags and materials needed for decontamination. Malteser International, an NGO that supplies the health zone with drugs, has had difficulty getting the products into the zone because of insecurity on the RN27 road.The principles of control are known and have been implemented (early treatment with the recommended antibiotics, isolation of the pneumonic cases, chemoprophylaxis given to the close contacts of the latest ones, rodent and flea control, safe and dignified burials, and the prevention of nosocomial transmission) but the means are limited and the health system is unable to manage the cases in the most appropriate way. The antibiotics used for the treatment of the cases are Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin and Cotrimoxazole. For the pulmonary or septicemic form case, Gentamycin was administrated. The lack of laboratory confirmation is worrying but the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) on the field ensures a minimum of confirmation among the suspected cases. The RDTs are especially reliable to confirm bubonic plague suspected forms.The risk at regional level is considered low since the epidemic seems to be contained in the Rethy health zone and that it is an isolated region. The risk is considered low globally.Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. The plague bacillus,\u00a0Y. pestis, enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates. At advanced stages of the infection, the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. There is no inter-human transmission of bubonic plague.Untreated, bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague, the most virulent form of plague. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, is almost always fatal. However, the probability of recovery is high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms).Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival and reduction of complications. Appropriate diagnostic samples include blood cultures, lymph node aspirates if possible, and/or sputum, if indicated. Drug therapy should begin as soon as possible after the laboratory specimens are taken. Post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated in persons with known exposure to plague, such as close contact with a pneumonic plague patient or direct contact with infected body fluids or tissues. Duration of post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent plague is seven days.Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague.Recommended response measures for all forms of plague:1As of 16 July 2020, there have been 8 162 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 191 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.WHO Plague factsheetWHO Plague website1As of 16 July 2020, there have been 8 162 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 191 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON286", "date_of_publication": "2020-07-09", "headline": "Influenza A(H1N2) - Brazil", "main_text": "On 22 June 2020, the International Health Regualtions (IHR) Focal Point (FP) of Brazil shared a preliminary report with the Panamerican Health Organization, the WHO Regional Office for the Americas of a human infection with\u00a0Influenza A(H1N2) variant virus (A(H1N2)v). According to the report, the patient, a 22-year-old female, with no comorbidities, worked in a swine slaughterhouse in Ibipor\u00e3 Municipality, Paran\u00e1 State, and developed an influenza-like illness on 12 April 2020. The patient initially sought medical care on 14 April and a respiratory specimen was obtained on 16 April as part of routine surveillance activities. The patient was treated with oseltamivir, was not hospitalized and has recovered.A real-time RT-PCR test conducted at the public health laboratory identified a non-subtypable influenza A virus. In May 2020, the specimen was forwarded to the Laboratory of Respiratory Virus and Measles, Oswaldo Cruz Institute (FIOCRUZ per its acronym in Portuguese), a national influenza reference laboratory, in Rio de Janeiro. On 22 June, genetic sequencing characterized this virus as an influenza A(H1N2)v virus.Further genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus from the patient is ongoing.On 26 June 2020, local authorities started a retrospective and prospective investigation in the slaughterhouse in Ibipor\u00e3 Municipality and other municipalities where the slaughterhouse workers live. According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, a second individual who also worked at the slaughterhouse developed respiratory symptoms during the same timeframe as the confirmed case, but no sample was collected from this person. No other suspected cases amongst contacts of the confirmed case have been identified.Information from the virological characterization and epidemiological investigation, especially on the patient\u2019s likely source of exposure to the virus and the identification any additional human cases will inform the risk assessment on the likelihood of any person-to-person transmission.To date, 26 cases of influenza A(H1N2)v have been reported to WHO since 2005, including two from Brazil. Most of the cases have presented with mild illness and there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission.Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such changes for risk assessment.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the\u00a0International Health Regulations (IHR)\u00a0and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.\u00a0Evidence of illness is not required for this report\u00a0.In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Influenza A(H1N2)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Brazil", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON285", "date_of_publication": "2020-07-02", "headline": "MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "Between 1 April and 31 May 2020, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported nine new cases of MERS-CoV infection, including five deaths. The cases were reported from Riyadh (seven cases), Assir (one case) and Northern (one case) Regions. Most cases were and ages of the reported cases ranged from 40 to 96 years.Of the cases reported in Riyadh six were from a hospital outbreak in the region between 21 and 31 May 2020: an index case who was a newly admitted patient, and five secondary cases identified through contact tracing. One of the secondary cases was a health care worker and the other four were in-patients admitted due to other health conditions. All four in-patients were bedridden and above 75 years of age. All reported cases had comorbidities with the exception of the healthcare worker.The link below provides details of the nine reported cases.MERS-CoV cases reported from 1 April through 31 May 2020Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Since 2012 until 31 May 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2 562 with 881 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV is more severe in infected people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO)", "location": ""}, {"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON284", "date_of_publication": "2020-06-26", "headline": "Ebola - African Region (AFRO), Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "On 25 June 2020, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared\u00a0the end of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces\u00a0. In accordance with\u00a0WHO recommendations, the declaration was made more than 42 days after the last person who contracted EVD in this outbreak tested negative twice and was discharged from care.The outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018 following investigations and laboratory confirmation of a cluster of EVD cases in North Kivu Province. Further investigations identified cases in Ituri and North Kivu Provinces with dates of symptom onset from May to August 2018. In 2019, the outbreak subsequently spread to South Kivu Province, and on 17 July 2019,\u00a0the WHO Director-General declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 11 outbreaks have been recorded since the first recognized outbreak in 1976. The 10th EVD outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces was the country's longest EVD outbreak and the second largest in the world after the 2014\u20132016 EVD outbreak in West Africa.The response to the outbreak was led by the Ministry of Health with support from WHO and partners in the areas of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory services, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces. The engagement of local leaders, communities and survivors in EVD survivor care programmes and community messaging played a central role in curtailing the outbreak. Challenges in establishing trust with affected communities, reticence for admission to Ebola treatment facilities, a high level of insecurity due to the presence of armed groups in the affected areas, as well as a series of attacks against health workers contributed to the difficulty of containing this outbreak.Despite these challenges, no new confirmed cases have been reported since April 2020, and North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces were declared Ebola-free 23 months after the first cases were reported. June 2020 marks the beginning of the handover of outbreak response and surveillance activities from the central government and international partners to the Provincial Health Divisions.From 17 to 23 June 2020, an average of 2790 alerts were reported per day and investigated. Of these, over 99% were investigated within 24 hours, and an average of 428 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. Sustained numbers of alerts have been reported daily since April 2020 due to strengthened capacity to detect emergent cases and continuous support of provincial health divisions and the Ministry of Health. The timely testing of suspected cases was achieved by a network of eight laboratories. From 15 to 21 June 2020, a total of 3219 samples were tested including 2665 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 323 swabs from community deaths; and 344 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, the number of samples tested by the laboratories increased by 4% compared to the previous week.From 1 August 2018 to 25 June 2020, a total of 3470 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones including 3317 confirmed cases and 153 probable cases. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1974) were female, 29% (n=1006) were children aged less than 18 years and 5% (n=171) were health care workers. There were 2287 deaths recorded (overall case fatality ratio 66%), 33% (1152/3470) of cases died outside of Ebola treatment centres, and 1171 cases recovered from EVD. Over the course of the outbreak, more than 250 000 contacts of cases were registered in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces.On 25 June 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. Although human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus has ended in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces and the outbreak has officially been declared over, the risk of re-emergence still exists. Therefore, there is a critical need to maintain response operations to rapidly detect and respond to any new cases and to prioritize ongoing support and care for people who recovered from EVD.Ebola virus can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months, and in rare cases may result in secondary transmission or in relapse, as seen in this outbreak. In addition, Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region, so there is continued risk of zoonotic spillover. Given that cases may continue to occur from time to time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, maintaining a robust surveillance system and response operations to rapidly detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases are essential.*Excludes n=71/3470 cases for whom onset dates not reported. Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. \u2018Other zones\u2019 indicate health zones other than Kalunguta, Mandima, Mabalako, Beni, Butembo & Katwa Health Zones which have been affected by EVD.In response to this EVD outbreak, from 1 August 2018 to 25 June 2020:For further information about public health response actions by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the CongoThe latest WHO assessment concluded that the current EVD outbreak has been contained, considering that more than 42 days (two incubation periods) have elapsed since the date of the second consecutive negative test of the last case confirmed case on 13 May 2020. On 26 June 2020, WHO maintained the risk assessment for this event as Moderate at the national and regional levels, and the risk level remained Low at the global level.Under the Consolidation and Stabilization Strategic Plan adopted by the Ministry of Health, enhanced surveillance, a long-term programme for Ebola survivor care, and other response mechanisms remain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain increased vigilance and contribute to strengthening and resilience of the local health systems.Given that EVD is likely to persist in an animal reservoir in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a new zoonotic spillover event may occur. Moreover, an EVD cluster may also occur from exposure to body fluids of survivors, although the probability of this will reduce over time.WHO considers ongoing challenges in access and security, community trust in authorities, fragile health systems, coupled with the emergence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera, measles and the EVD outbreak recently reported in \u00c9quateur Province, as factors that might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence of EVD cases in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces.As per the advice of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee, which was convened on 26 June 2020, the WHO Director-General declared that the EVD outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

He had onset of symptoms on 30 January 2020 and presented to a health facility on 2 February 2020 with abdominal pain and jaundice. Between 2 February and 9 April, he consulted the Urban Health Centre in Tchibanga, the Christian Alliance Hospital in Bongolo and the University hospital in the capital Libreville where the case received anti-malarial treatment and remained hospitalized until his death on 9 April 2020. On 14 April 2020, the laboratory results received from the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed yellow fever infection, by seroneutralisation test. The additional differential diagnostic tests performed were negative for dengue, West Nile fever, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever, Zika and Rift Valley fever.On 15 April 2020, a multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted in Tchibanga by the Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from WHO. According to the field investigation report, the case had no recent travel history prior to the onset of illness and no additional cases were found in the community despite extensive case finding activities.The last cases of yellow fever in Gabon were detected in 2019. These two confirmed cases of yellow fever were in unvaccinated international workers in the health district of Mitzic, Woleu-Ntem Region.The yellow fever vaccine was introduced into routine immunization in 2000. Yellow fever vaccination coverage in Gabon is reported to be suboptimal (less than 85%) (WHO/UNICEF estimates, 2018). The case is from Mongo health area, where vaccination coverage is 76% in 2020.Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unvaccinated populations.The detection of the confirmed case of yellow fever in Nyanga Province shows the possibility of spill-over of sylvatic yellow fever in endemic areas to unvaccinated people in a rural area even in the context of moderately high population immunity (70%). This highlights the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever.There is currently a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to COVID-19 related impacts on the health system and a decreased demand for immunization due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the numbers of susceptible people and the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. As of 12 June 2020, there have been 3,463 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Gabon.Gabon is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for the prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers to Gabon, from nine months of age.Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and has developed specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. The EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive yellow fever activities according to\u00a0WHO guidance.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Travellers returning to Gabon who may be infected with yellow fever may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Gabon on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "African Region (AFRO)", "location": ""}, {"country": "Gabon", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON281", "date_of_publication": "2020-06-11", "headline": "Ebola - African Region (AFRO), Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "No new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 27 April 2020 (Figure 1).The source of infection of the cluster reported in April 2020 remains unconfirmed.From 4 to 10 June 2020, an average of 3357 alerts were reported per day, of which 3346 (over 99%) were investigated within 24 hours.

She had onset of symptoms on 31 January 2020 and presented to a health facility on 3 February 2020 with fever and aches. The following day she developed jaundice and a blood sample was taken. On 7 February , the blood sample was transported to the national laboratory. On 10 February , the sample from the case was received at the national laboratory and test results on 17 March were Immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive for yellow fever. The positive yellow fever result was confirmed by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar Senegal, a yellow fever reference laboratory on 14 April 2020 by seroneutralisation.On 22 March 2020, a multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted. According to the field investigation report, the case had no recent travel history prior to the onset of illness and no additional cases were found during active case finding in the community. The parents of the case reported that she was vaccinated in 2007; however no vaccination certificate is available. According to a survey conducted as part of the investigation, no additional cases of acute febrile jaundice were identified and 84% (132/157) of respondents reported previous yellow fever vaccination (through verbal recall and/or vaccination cards).Togo has a robust febrile jaundice surveillance system, with weekly case reporting and sample testing. In 2019, 349 cases of febrile jaundice were reported and tested negative for yellow fever in the laboratory. All 44 health districts reported at least one case of febrile jaundice in 2019.The last yellow fever outbreak in Togo occurred during late 2006 and early 2007, when three cases were reported from two adjacent districts: Dankpen district, Kara region and Oti district, Savanes region in the northern part of the country. In January 2007, two additional laboratory confirmed cases were reported: one from Kara region (Kozah district) and one from Maritime region (Lacs district). During preparation for the outbreak campaign, two additional laboratory confirmed cases were reported from Haho district. Following this outbreak, a national reactive vaccination campaign was conducted in 2007 and covered the entire country, targeting over 5.3 million people with over 102% reported administrative coverage.From January to April 2020, 52 cases of febrile jaundice were reported, including one confirmed case of yellow fever in Oti district.The yellow fever vaccine was introduced into routine immunization in January 2005. Yellow fever vaccination coverage in Togo is reported to be high (>85%), however, it is lower in the affected health area (Galangashie) (78% coverage in 2019). As a whole, Savanes region had a high coverage following the 2007 mass vaccination campaigns.While immunity gaps may persist or have been introduced following population movements, there is a relatively high population immunity that has benefited from past vaccination activities and is anticipated to be protective against a widespread epidemic. This confirmed case illustrates that occasional yellow fever cases may occur in unvaccinated individuals due to sylvatic transmission, even in the context of high population immunity. This case underscores the importance of ensuring every person living in a high-risk area has lifelong protection afforded them by a single dose of yellow fever vaccine.The detection of the yellow fever case in Savanes region shows that even in the context of relatively high population immunity there is a possibility of sylvatic yellow fever in unvaccinated people in rural areas. This highlights the importance of maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever. Recent entomological studies have indicated the presence of competent vectors, including the Aedes species, and the potential for spread to surrounding regions.The onset of the rainy season could increase the density of mosquito vectors, further exacerbating the risk of spread.While mass immunization took place in Togo in 2007, the country is considered to be high risk for endemic transmission. Unvaccinated people remain vulnerable to yellow fever infection, particularly in rural areas.Due to current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burdens on the health system and a decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. A disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine preventable diseases. As of 04 June 2020, there have been 452 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Togo.Togo is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. In January 2005 the yellow fever vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization programme in Togo. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers to Togo, from nine months of age. Togo also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged nine months or older arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers having more than 12 hours of transit through an airport in a country with risk of yellow fever transmission.Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. When conditions permit, the EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive yellow fever vaccination activities according to\u00a0WHO guidance.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures, including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Travellers returning to Togo who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Togo on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.WHO yellow fever fact sheetWHO strategy for yellow fever epidemic preparedness and responseWHO list of countries with vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellersA Global strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) 2017-2026, WHO 2018,Guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemicA Global Strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE), document for SAGE \u2013 26 September 2016Framework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "African Region (AFRO)", "location": ""}, {"country": "Togo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON278", "date_of_publication": "2020-06-04", "headline": "Ebola - African Region (AFRO), Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "No new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 27 April 2020 (Figure 1).The source of infection of the cluster reported in April 2020 remains unconfirmed.From 27 May to 2 June 2020, an average of 2870 alerts were reported per day, of which 2867 (over 99%) were investigated within 24 hours.

All cases had experienced fever and bleeding prior to their deaths. Of the four patients who died, two of them visited the General Reference Hospital (HGR) in Wangata; a sample (swab) was taken from one of them who died on 30 May. Safe and dignified burials were not performed for these four patients.On 31 May, the brother of the probable case who died on 22 May and his wife presented to HGR Wangata; both had fever, non-bloody diarrhoea and vomiting. They were placed in isolation after blood samples were collected.The three samples including two blood samples and a swab, were analyzed at a laboratory in Mbandaka where all three samples tested positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD) by GeneXpert Ebola assay. One of the three samples (swab) was sent on 31 May 2020, to the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) in Kinshasa and tested positive for Zaire Ebolavirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).As of 2 June 2020, eight epidemiologically-linked cases, including two confirmed alive cases, two suspected cases and four deaths (one confirmed and three probable deaths), have been reported. The Ministry of Health (MOH) officially declared the outbreak in Equateur Province on 1 June 2020.Equateur Province experienced an EVD outbreak with 54 cases and 33 deaths, reported between 8 May 2018 through 24 July 2018. This is the eleventh outbreak of EVD reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the virus was discovered in 1976.In the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the health capacity and resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are already strained and causing additional burdens on the national health system. The risk of disruption to surveillance and routine public health activities due to COVID-19 might jeopardize the country\u2019s ability to rapidly contain re-emergence of these EVD cases. As of 2 June 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 3 194 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths.WHO, with the MOH, are implementing a coordinated rapid response to stop the spread of the outbreak, and to identify any other suspect cases and initiate contact tracing. In-depth epidemiological investigation and contact tracing were initiated on 31 May 2020.The MOH, with support from WHO and partners have planned the following actions:The laboratory capacity in Mbandaka is being assessed and support is on-going for appropriate set-up and additional supplies. Safe and dignified burial activities could resume shortly following proper community engagement. Support for case management is also important to ensure provision of care to affected individuals.WHO did not receive adequate EVD funding since the start of 2020, and is currently using its emergency funds to support the epidemiological and public health interventions. Financial and human resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners are challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.WHO notes that the current resurgence is undesirable, but not unexpected given the identification of wildlife spillover potential in Africa, accompanied by the high population density in the region and considering the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that could influence the emergence of EVD.There is a need for: epidemiologists to conduct disease surveillance; infection prevention and control (IPC) specialists; vaccinators; case management and laboratory staff; and, risk communication and community engagement experts. Materials for infection prevention and control (IPC) and personal protective equipment (PPE), cold-chain, reagents for laboratory diagnostics, and means of transportation are required for the teams.The area where the cases and deaths were reported, is populated with poor and vulnerable populations, known to be reluctant to social mobilization. This might pose further challenges in terms of case investigation, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, and vaccination in the coming days.Additional challenges have been identified regarding:The investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak and therefore high vigilance should be maintained. This information will help define the risk in the coming days.Ebola virus disease transmission in humans:WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.Ebola virus disease fact sheetEbola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the CongoHistory of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo:Statement on the 1st meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in 2018Statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 July 2019Statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 18 October 2019Statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 12 February 2020Statement on the 5th meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 14 April 2020COVID-19: Operational guidance for maintaining essential health services during an outbreakWHO press release, New Ebola outbreak detected in northwest Democratic Republic of the Congo; WHO surge team supporting the response", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON276", "date_of_publication": "2020-05-28", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "From 20 to 26 May 2020, no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Figure 1).Since the resurgence of the outbreak on 10 April 2020, seven confirmed cases have been reported from Kasanga, Malepe and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas in Beni Health Zone. Investigations into the origin of the last cluster of cases in Beni Health Zone are ongoing. To date, no definitive source of infection has been identified.From 20 to 26 May 2020, an average of 2715 alerts were reported per day, of which 2709 (over 99%) were investigated within 24 hours. Of these, an average of 404 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. In the past two weeks, there was a slight decrease in overall and validated alerts in Beni Health Zone. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from eight laboratories. From 18 to 24 May 2020, 3065 samples were tested including 2313 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 331 swabs from community deaths; and 421 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities increased by 7% compared to the previous week.On 22 May, two historic probable cases reported in Mabalako and Lubero Health Zones were validated from people who had onset of symptoms in March 2019 and July 2019. As of 26 May 2020, a total of 3463 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 146 probable cases have been reported. Of these, 2280 people died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) and 1171 survived. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.On 14 May 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo began the 42-day countdown to the declaration of the end of the EVD outbreak. Given the long duration and large magnitude of this outbreak and the fact that the virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region, there is a risk of re-emergence of the virus in the period leading up to, and beyond, the declaration of the end of the outbreak. It is crucial to maintain a strong and robust surveillance system in order to detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases as early as possible and to break possible chains of transmission. Continued coordination and communication among partners, authorities and affected communities along with EVD survivor advocacy remain essential in this outbreak response.**Total cases and areas affected during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further information about public health response actions by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:On 14 April 2020, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from High to Moderate at the national and regional levels, while the risk level remained Low at the global level.

As of 27 April 2020, the Ethiopian Dracunculiasis Eradication Program (EDEP) had detected one additional person with an emerged worm, morphologically consistent with human guinea worm, bringing the total to seven suspected cases. This report comes after more than two consecutive years of zero reporting, as the last cases were reported in December 2017. Since its establishment in 1993, the EDEP has made remarkable progress towards interruption of disease transmission in humans despite the existence of low-level transmission of the parasite in non-human hosts such as dogs and peri-domestic baboons.Of the seven suspected cases, five were detected from the Angota side of Duli village and two suspected cases from Metaget Dipach and Wadmaro villages in Gog Dipach Kebele. All the infected people used unsafe drinking water from farm ponds. These water sources were reported to be associated with the baboon infection in June 2019 in the same village.Worm specimens from all the suspected cases have been collected and are ready for shipment to the US Centers for Disease Control laboratory for confirmation1. Morphologically, all specimens are consistent with\u00a0Dracunculus medinensis.*The seven cases of 2020 are pending confirmationIn response to the outbreak, a team composed of members from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), Gambella Regional Health Bureau (RHB) and The Carter Center (TCC), the main global partner of WHO in support of guinea worm eradication, carried out a preliminary investigation and instituted immediate intervention measures.These include:Dracunculiasis, one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis (nematode-roundworm).It is transmitted usually by drinking water containing water fleas-also called copepods (small crustaceans) which are infected with larvae of\u00a0D. medinensis. Eating uncooked fish or other aquatic animals bearing the guinea worm infected larvae is another plausible route of transmission. Following ingestion, the larvae migrate through the intestinal wall into body tissues, where they develop into adult worms and slowly migrate in the subcutaneous tissues toward the skin surface, causing painful blisters that rupture when it comes in contact with water, allowing the female worm to emerge and release larvae.The larvae are ingested by the copepods and after two weeks, these larvae metamorphose in the body cavities of the copepods and become infective. From the time infection occurs, it takes between 10\u201314 months for the transmission cycle to complete until a mature worm emerges from the body.Symptoms of guinea worm disease can include the following: Dizziness, a mild fever, uncomfortable rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.While the death rate is low, disability is a common outcome of guinea worm disease: infected people become non-functional for weeks or months. People have difficulty moving around because of the pain and complications caused by secondary bacterial infections. The disability that occurs during worm removal and recovery prevents people from working in their fields, tending animals, going to school, and caring for their families; hence, creating an economic and social burden for affected communities along with a vicious circle of poverty.It affects people in rural, deprived and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources such as ponds for drinking water. Guinea worm disease occurs in the poorest 10% of the world\u2019s population who have no access to safe drinking water or health care. People who live in villages where there has been a case of guinea worm disease in a human or animal in the recent past are at greatest risk.While Guinea worm transmission is limited to only two districts (Gog and Abobo of Gambella region) in Ethiopia, the presence of hard to reach communities and lack of safe water sources in remote non-village areas, a large refugee influx, and animal infections with an unknown role in transmission of dracunculiasis, remain significant challenges for guinea worm disease elimination in Ethiopia.In Ethiopia, only the region of Gambella remains endemic for the disease. Current human cases are reported from Gog district in this region. In Gog and Abobo districts of the Gambella region, a low-level transmission of guinea worm among dogs and peri-domestic baboons is being reported. Hence, communities living in the area are at higher risk of contracting the disease.The potential for the international spread is low. However, as a result of the regular cross-border population movement between Ethiopia and South Sudan, due to insecurity in South Sudan and activities of nomadic pastoralists, the risk of spreading Guinea worm disease between the two countries always remains high.Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems are strained worldwide due to the rapidly increasing demand of services for the management of this disease and other existing ones. Support from The Carter Center and WHO has reinforced active surveillance in all the communities of Gog and Abobo districts including those living in cross-border areas, particularly in and around refugee camps, to prevent any spread of the disease to South Sudan.There is no vaccine to prevent the disease, nor is there any medication to treat patients. Prevention is possible, as successful implementation of preventive strategies have driven the disease to the verge of eradication. Prevention strategies include:Currently they are only five countries with indigenous transmission of the disease: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali2\u00a0and South Sudan. Each country has its own national Guinea Worm Eradication Program.After claiming interruption of transmission, endemic countries must show and document evidence of absence of indigenous transmission of guinea worm disease for at least three consecutive years to be eligible for consideration by the International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (ICCDE). The ICCDE decides, after satisfactory deliberation, whether or not to recommend the country for certification by the World Health Organization as free of guinea worm transmission.WHO, Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) fact sheetWHO, Dracunculiasis eradicationThe Carter Center, Guinea Worm Case TotalsThe Carter Center, Guinea worm outbreak in Ethiopia in 2017CDC Parasites - Guinea WormElimination of Guinea Worm Disease in Ethiopia; Current Status of the Disease\u2019s, Eradication Strategies and Challenges to the End GameWHO guidance document - COVID-19: Operational guidance for maintaining essential health services during an outbreak1WHO requirement: All worm specimens should be obtained from each case for laboratory confirmation and sent to the WHO Collaborating Center for Research, Training, and Control of Dracunculiasis at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2Mali has not reported human cases for four consecutive years (2016-2019) but continued to report indigenous transmission among animals.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dracunculiasis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "African Region (AFRO)", "location": ""}, {"country": "Ethiopia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON275", "date_of_publication": "2020-05-21", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "From 13 to 19 May 2020, no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported from North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Figure 1).

Children aged 9 to 59 months were the most affected age group, with 80% of cases in children aged 9 years or younger.Table 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of measles by age and sexThe outbreak was identified when suspected measles cases had been reported by the local residents in the surrounding areas, highlighting pockets of under-vaccinated populations. According to WHO/UNICEF 2018 estimates, measles first dose vaccination coverage is relatively high (88%), and slightly lower for the second dose (77%). However, this does not reflect the vaccination coverage of incoming refugees.As of 27 April 2020, 857 confirmed measles cases have been notified from four districts, including: Cibitoke (624 cases), Butezi (221 cases), Cankuzo (6 cases) and South Bujumbura (6 cases). Of the measles cases in Cibitoke, 601 cases were epidemiologically linked, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, and three were clinically diagnosed. In Butezi district, 27 were laboratory confirmed, 192 were epidemiologically linked, and two were clinically diagnosed. In Cankuzo, all six cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in the district of South Bujumbura three were laboratory confirmed and three were epidemiologically linked. Children aged 9 to 59 months were the most affected age group, with 80% of cases in children aged 9 years or younger.No new cases have been reported in South district of Bujumbura and Cankuzo since December 2019. The last cases were reported in Butezi on 2 March 2020.The outbreak in Cibitoke is ongoing. The last case in the Transit camp of Cishemere was reported on 14 January 2020). Globally, the total cases reported in Cishemere Transit Camp and Cibitoke health district are 67 and 557 respectively.Measles circulation in a population with low immunity is the cause of this outbreak. The majority of cases (77%) were either unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination status.The Ministry of Public Health of Burundi, with partners including WHO, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC), have developed a comprehensive measles outbreak response plan which includes the following public health measures:WHO estimates that the current measles epidemic represents a high risk for Burundi for the following reasons:In addition to low immunity, gaps in measles-rubella surveillance in the country, confirmed by the 2019 measles risk analysis, showed that 63% of districts (29/46 health districts) were at high risk, including 13 districts at very high-risk of measles outbreak. This shows that the country's surveillance system might not be able to detect outbreaks of measles if it is not strengthened.Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and two doses of MCV are recommended to ensure immunity. Conducting targeted reactive vaccination campaigns and strengthening routine vaccination are essential for effective control of the epidemic. The administration of Vitamin A, particularly in the context of malnutrition, can reduce morbidity and mortality from measles.WHO urges all Member States to:WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Burundi based on the information available on the current outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Burundi", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON270", "date_of_publication": "2020-05-05", "headline": "MERS-CoV - Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "The link below provides details of the 15 reported cases.20200429_mers_saudi_arabiaSince 2012 until 31 March 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2553 with 876 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV is more severe in infected people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON271", "date_of_publication": "2020-04-30", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "Since the resurgence of the outbreak on 10 April 2020, seven confirmed cases have been reported, all from Beni Health Zone. Of these, one is receiving care at the Beni Ebola treatment centre (ETC), one who was receiving care at the ETC recovered and was discharged, and one remains in the community. Response teams are engaging with the community in order to try to bring that person to the ETC for access to treatment and supportive care, and to prevent further transmission in the community. Four of the people confirmed to have Ebola died, including two community deaths and two deaths in the ETC in Beni.Specimens from all confirmed cases were sent to the Institut Research Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) for genetic sequencing to support surveillance teams in investigating the source of infection. Laboratory sequencing of the virus showed that six out of seven cases were linked to the same chain confirmed in July 2019, suggesting exposure to a persistent source of infection. Individuals in the current cluster may have been infected by direct contact with body fluids of a survivor (asymptomatic or relapse case). Investigations into the transmission chains from July 2019 in Beni and Katwa Health Zones and the confirmed cases reported in April 2020 are ongoing in order to identify the origin of the current cluster of EVD cases.Surveillance performances have improved compared to last week, although alert rates remain suboptimal. A total of 970 contacts of the seven recent confirmed cases have been registered; among these contacts, 897 (92%) were followed and 726 (75%) were vaccinated. Of the 970 contacts, 382 (40%) were high risk contacts (direct contact with body fluids of confirmed cases). As of 28 April 2020, 57 (15%) of the 382 high risk contacts of confirmed cases have been offered accommodation in a dedicated facility where they are provided with food and other essential goods, to allow for closer monitoring and prompt isolation and provision of care to those who might become symptomatic.From 22 to 28 April 2020, an average of 2152 alerts were reported and investigated per day. Of these, an average of 230 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from eight laboratories. From 20 to 26 April 2020, 1544 samples were tested including 961 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 285 swabs from community deaths; and 298 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities increased by 50% compared to the previous week.As of 28 April 2020, a total of 3462 EVD cases, including 3316 confirmed and 145 probable cases have been reported, of which 2279 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1961) were female, 29% (n=996) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers. As of 28 April, a total of 1170 cases have recovered from EVD.Response teams face a number of challenges, including limited response resources because of other local and global emergencies, and the presence of armed groups which limits access to some communities. It is essential to detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases as early as possible in order to improve outcome of cases and break the chain of transmission.

However, Venezuela and Brazil lost their \u2018measles-free\u2019 status on 1 July 2018 and 19 February 2019 respectively due to major measles outbreaks between 2018 and 2019. Of 35 Member States, 33 have maintained the \u2018measles-free\u2019 status. In 2019, 14 countries in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of measles including Brazil (19,326 cases, including 15 deaths), the United States of America (1,282 cases), Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (548 cases, including 3 deaths), Colombia (242 cases, including 1 death), Canada (113 cases), Argentina (107 cases), Mexico (20 cases), Chile (11 cases), Costa Rica (10 cases), Uruguay (9 cases), Bahamas (3 cases), Peru (2 cases), Cuba (1 case), and St. Lucia (1 case). Between 1 January and 4 April 2020, seven countries have reported confirmed measles cases including Brazil (2,194 cases, 4 deaths), Mexico (124 cases), Argentina (54 cases, 1 death), the United States of America (12 cases), Uruguay (2 cases), Chile (2 cases), and Canada (1 case).Actions implemented by the Health authorities include:Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10\u201312 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one of several of the following: runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2\u20133 weeks.Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.Because of ongoing transmission, vaccination strategies and other actions are being implemented to control the outbreak by local and state level authorities in Mexico. There is a high risk of spreading of the virus due to high population density such as Mexico City, in which the high vaccination coverage could allow slow but steady transmission. At the regional level, the potential impact is considered moderate given the performance of routine immunization programs and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the region and the restrictions for travel in many countries and territories of the Region due to the pandemic of COVID-19.Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.Since 1 September 2017, the Pan American Health Organization WHO Regional Office of the Americas (PAHO/WHO) has been sharing information on these outbreaks with its Member States and has alerted of the risk of outbreaks occurring from imported measles cases, as well as of the possibility of re-introduction of the disease in areas with low vaccination coverage. In light of continuous reports of imported measles cases from other Regions and ongoing outbreaks in the Americas, PAHO / WHO urges all Member States to follow the new recommendations on the\u00a0Guidance for Immunization in the context of the COVID-19\u00a0settings.Among the recommendations for countries with measles outbreaks, the following are highlighted:1Mexico probable measles/rubella case definition: Any person of any age with fever and maculopapular rash, and one or more of the following signs and symptoms: cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, or adenomegaly (retroauricular, occipital, or cervical).

Since 2019, only circulation of DENV-1 has been established in Mayotte. However, epidemics caused by other serotypes are currently underway in the Indian Ocean area, making it possible for another serotype to be introduced to Mayotte. A shift in the predominant DENV serotype may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and severe dengue cases requiring hospitalization and good case management. A comprehensive risk communication should be developed.Due to the presence and sufficient density of the competent vectors (Aedes albopictus\u00a0and\u00a0Aedes aegypti), hot and humid climate, and the current rainy season (tropical maritime climate with a hot rainy season from November to May), further upsurge in cases cannot be ruled out.Responding to the dengue outbreak in Mayotte might be challenging due to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation and overwhelmed health care facilities. As of 18 April 2020, Mayotte reported 263 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the population, might have difficulty accessing the health system. The population in Mayotte is young but includes vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged people, racial and ethnic minorities, those who are uninsured, and individuals with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, who often encounter barriers to accessing healthcare services.Mayotte only has one hospital and 16 beds in the intensive care unit, and recourse to traditional medicine is also frequent. Additionally, underreporting of dengue cases cannot be excluded.There is no specific treatment for dengue. However, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe cases of dengue, and appropriate early case management are key elements of care to prevent deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease. Outer islands should refer cases or seek help as early as possible.Additionally, Integrated Vector Management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent vector-person contact.Given that\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes, the competent vector, has greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended, such as wearing protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and using repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes strictly as instructed on the label. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide) can be useful to reduce vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night.Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented. During lockdown situations due to COVID-19,\u00a0households should be encouraged to work together in and around their homes to remove stagnant water, reduce solid wastes and to ensure proper covering of all water storage containers. This can be done as a weekly family activity and will help lower the density of mosquitoes.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Mayotte on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "France", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON269", "date_of_publication": "2020-04-23", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "In total, six cases have been reported since 10 April, four of whom have passed away; two in the community and two in an Ebola treatment centre (ETC).

Among the total suspected cases, 6 samples tested positive at EPHI national laboratory and they have been referred to UVRI for confirmation.The risk at national level is assessed as high. The current outbreak in Gurage Zone, SNNP region shows rapid amplification of a yellow fever outbreak in a rural area. In the context of virtually no population immunity, the high number of suspect cases reported over a short time period is of high concern. The recent confirmation of the outbreak in cases with no history of travel is a concern. This is an indication of the existence of conducive factors for an increased incidence of yellow fever transmission and the spread of the disease beyond the hotspot areas.Recent entomological studies, in addition to previous entomological studies conducted in 2018, have indicated the presence of competent vectors including Aedes species and the potential for spread to surrounding zones. The onset of the rainy season could increase density of mosquito vectors, thereby further exacerbating risk of spread.Travellers returning to Ethiopia who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The last yellow fever outbreak occurred in the SNNP region in August 2018, with a total of 35 cases (30 suspected and 5 confirmed cases) reported from the Wolayita Zone in the SNNP region, Ethiopia. While immunization took place in selected aspects of Wolayita Zone, the communities in Gurage zone remain vulnerable to yellow fever infection.There is currently a low risk at the regional level due to limited population movement both nationally and internationally because of COVID-19 related controls on borders (air/land).WHO assesses the overall risk to be low at the global level.Ethiopia is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Introduction of yellow fever vaccination into routine immunization is planned for 2020. Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers 9 months of age or older going to Ethiopia. Ethiopia also requires a yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged 9 months or older arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers having transited for more than 12 hours through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. WHO does not generally recommend vaccination for travellers whose itineraries are limited to Afar and Somali provinces.Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005), third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection.WHO has published guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently developing specific operational guidance for conducting mass vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 context. When conditions permit, the EYE Strategy will support rapid resumption of preventive YF activities according to\u00a0WHO guidance.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Ethiopia on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Ethiopia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON262", "date_of_publication": "2020-04-18", "headline": "Yellow Fever - South Sudan", "main_text": "The investigation was mounted in response to the recently declared outbreak in bordering Moyo district, Uganda. During the investigation, the team collected 41 blood samples from five villages which were in close proximity to the bordering Moyo district, Uganda. Of the 41 individuals whose samples were collected, nine (22%) had history of fever, but none had history of jaundice. The individuals represented a spectrum of occupations typical for the area (farming, forestry, homemaker, soldier). Most of the individuals investigated were between 20-45 years of age, and 18 (44%) of these individuals were female.In addition, a rapid entomology survey in the villages found evidence of multiple mosquito breeding sites and abundant\u00a0Aedes\u00a0species mosquitos (e.g.\u00a0Aegypti\u00a0,\u00a0Albopictus,\u00a0Simpsoni).As of 28 March 2020, these are the only two cases (no deaths) that have been confirmed from Kajo Keji county.South Sudan has experienced several yellow fever outbreaks in the past. The last outbreak was declared on 29 November 2018, in Sakure payam, Nzara County, Gbudue State (present Western Equatoria State) when three laboratory confirmed cases with no associated deaths were reported. To respond to the outbreak, a targeted reactive vaccination campaign was mounted in the affected area. Prior to this outbreak, in May 2003, a total of 178 cases with 27 deaths were reported in Imatong region, Torit Country, South Sudan. A reactive vaccination campaign was mounted to respond to the outbreak in 2003.Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection, which provides immunity for life.The risk of ongoing and further transmission of yellow fever is concerning in South Sudan due to :Close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing is needed.Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk to be high at the national level and regional level.South Sudan is classified as a high-risk country in the \u201cEliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics\u201d (EYE) initiative. Epidemic spread of Yellow Fever is a risk in South Sudan as the estimated overall population immunity is negligible with nearly 0% immunity in Kajo Keji County.Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever and provides immunity for life. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. The country plans to introduce Yellow Fever vaccination into the routine immunization program and complete preventive mass vaccination activities to rapidly boost population immunity. Expedited planning and implementation of these activities to protect the population will help avert risk of future outbreaks.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers aged 9 months and above going to South Sudan as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. However, yellow fever vaccination is not recommended for infants aged 6 to 8 months, except during epidemics when the risk of yellow fever virus transmission may be very high. The risks and benefits of vaccination in this age group should be carefully considered before vaccination. The vaccine should be used with caution during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, pregnant or breastfeeding women may be vaccinated during epidemics or if travel to a country or area with risk of transmission is unavoidable. South Sudan also requires, as a condition of entry, a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged 9 months and above.In accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), Third Edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends throughout the life of the person vaccinated. The International Certificate of Vaccination becomes valid 10 days after vaccination. A single dose of WHO approved yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and is not required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourage its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. As a general precaution, WHO also recommends avoidance of mosquito bites. The highest risk for transmission of yellow fever virus is during the day and early evening. Travellers should be made aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Travelers returning to South Sudan who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Republic of South Sudan on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "South Sudan", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON268", "date_of_publication": "2020-04-16", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "Specimens from all confirmed cases were sent to the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Katwa and in Kinshasa for genetic sequencing in order to support surveillance teams in the investigation of the source of infection and to determine whether these cases were linked to a known chain of transmission. A total of 332 contacts of these cases have been registered, 248 of whom were followed on 14 April 2020, and 200 of whom were vaccinated by three vaccination teams that have been activated. While approximately 6,000 doses are available in Beni Health Zone, WHO anticipates potential challenges with the vaccine pipeline due to limited flight ability as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.From 8 to 14 April 2020, an average of 2015 alerts were reported and investigated per day. Of these, an average of 177 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. The alert rate has decreased for the past three weeks as teams are pulled into other emergencies, including COVID-19. Other challenges include the presence of armed groups and limited access to some affected health areas, movement of contacts, and possible under-reporting to the central coordination of the outbreak response. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 11 laboratories. From 6 to 12 April 2020, 968 samples were tested including 466 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 274 swabs from community deaths; and 228 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities decreased by 28% compared to the previous week.On 9 April 2020, two new probable cases, with onset of symptoms in November 2019 and December 2019, were retrospectively validated. As of 14 April 2020, a total of 3458 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1), including 3313 confirmed and 145 probable cases, of which 2277 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1943) were female, 28% (n=982) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.An urgent injection of US $20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020.

The\u00a0WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak\u00a0includes a 42-day waiting period because undetected chains of transmission or new flare-ups may arise. The sequencing analysis will be critical to inform the investigation of the source of infection and to help detect any missed cases in the chain of transmission that led to this cluster.

The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON260", "date_of_publication": "2020-04-02", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "It is therefore critical to maintain surveillance and response operations in the period leading up to the declaration of the end of the outbreak, as well as after the declaration \u2013 as outlined in the\u00a0WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.Ongoing outbreak response efforts continue, which include investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnosis of suspected cases (which continue to be detected), supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme, and strategically transitioning activities.

On 9 March, the last 46 contacts finished their follow-up. These are important milestones in the outbreak as over one maximum incubation period has passed without any confirmed cases of EVD. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD, and a critical need to maintain response operations \u2013 as outlined in the\u00a0 WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.Extensive surveillance, pathogen detection, clinical management and other response activities are currently ongoing. These include, but are not limited to, investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnostics of suspected cases which continue to be detected each day, and supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme to help mitigate potential risks of re-emergence. Over the course of the past week (4\u201310 March 2020), over 32 000 alerts were reported and investigated, and 2584 alerts were validated as suspected cases; requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. From 2 to 8 March, 2818 samples were tested including: 1574 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 376 swabs from community deaths; and 868 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, this was a 16% decrease in testing compared to the previous week.Throughout the outbreak, alert rates steadily climbed as active and passive case finding systems were strengthened, reaching additional health zones with the evolution of the outbreak, and continuously adapted to suit local context. With the decline in confirmed case incidence and gradual transition toward routine disease surveillance systems, alert rates have expectantly begun to decline in some areas. It, however, remains important for appropriate levels of surveillance to be maintained through the end of outbreak declaration to rapidly detect relapse, reintroduction or new emergence events, thereby providing an opportunity to implement effective control measures and avoid a potential resurgence of the outbreak.As of 10 March 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%).

Details of the reported case is as follows:The case-patient is a\u202f65-year-old male national, living in Doha. He developed cough, palpitations, dizziness, chills and rigor on 9 February,\u202fand was admitted to a hospital on the same day. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 17 February and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (UpE and Orf1a genes) at the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (DLMP) in Hamad Medical Corporation on 17 February. He has underlying comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease. He is in critical condition and has been isolated in the intensive care unit. The case-patient has a history of close contact with dromedary camels in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.Since 2012, including this\u202fcase, Qatar has reported 23 human cases of MERS-CoV. From October 2012 until 5 March 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2521 with 866 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Upon identification, the case was isolated and infection prevention and control protocols were implemented as per\u00a0WHO guidelines. Investigations and contact tracing were initiated.As of 5 March, a total of 106 contacts have been identified, including 13 household, eight occupational and 85 health care workers. All contacts of the patient were monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for a period of 14 days following their last exposure to the patient. No secondary cases were identified.All contacts of the patient tested negative for MERS-CoV.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard preventive measures when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Qatar", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON251", "date_of_publication": "2020-03-10", "headline": "Dengue Fever - Region of the Americas (PAHO) - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin, and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy", "main_text": "On 12 February 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported an increase in the number of cases of dengue infection in French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint-Martin. In January 2020, health authorities in the region declared a dengue epidemic in Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin and indicated that Martinique is also at-risk of an epidemic.Dengue epidemics in these territories usually occur when there is a shift in the predominant circulating DENV serotype, and non-immune populations (e.g., tourists, new immigrants, or people not previously exposed to the circulating serotypes) are exposed to the new serotype through human movements within the territories or across neighboring countries. Local transmission occurs through the\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquito vector present on the islands and in French Guiana.From January 2019 through 17 February 2020, a total of 487 confirmed cases of dengue, with no severe cases or deaths, was reported (Figure 1). The most affected communes were Kourou, on the coastline, with 225 confirmed cases, and Maripasoula, in the south-eastern part of French Guiana with 55 confirmed cases. Except during 2017 and 2018, dengue cases have been reported every year, with the most recent largest outbreak reported in 2013, resulting in 13,240 suspected cases including 6 deaths.Laboratory tests identified DENV-1 and DENV -2 as the predominant serotypes circulating in 2019 and 2020 (as at February 17, 2020). So far in 2020, DENV-2 has accounted for 63% of reported cases.Source: Le point \u00e9pid\u00e9mio, Sant\u00e9 publique France \u2013 Cellule Guyane, 20 February 2020 and reproduced by PAHO/WHOFrom 14 October 2019 through 16 February 2020, a total of 5,840 cases of dengue, with no severe cases or deaths, was reported. Of these, more than 1,200 were confirmed by the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-three percent (n = 2,540) of the total number of cases were reported since the beginning of January 2020 (Figure 2).From 19 January through 16 February 2020, clinically diagnosed cases were reported in 14 of the 24 communes with a sentinel general practitioner (out of a total of 32 communes that make up the archipelago). Most of the cases were reported in the following communes: Basse-Terre, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Petit-Canal, Petit-Bourg, Pointe-Noire, and Saint-Fran\u00e7ois and the isle of Marie-Galante (eastern and central part of the main island). The most recent largest outbreak reported in Guadeloupe was in 2013, with 12,706 suspected cases including 8 deaths.Between 2005 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-4 (2005), DENV-2 (2006 and 2007) and DENV-1 (2008 and 2010). In 2019, laboratory tests identified DENV-2 as the predominant dengue serotype, which is currently circulating and has been reported in all of the affected areas.Source: Le point \u00e9pid\u00e9mio, Sant\u00e9 publique France \u2013 Cellule Antilles, 20 February 2020 and reproduced by PAHO/WHOFrom July 2019 through 16 February 2020, 2,470 suspected cases of dengue and 575 cases confirmed by the NS1 antigen test and/or RT-PCR, including two severe cases and one death, were reported (Figure 3). Forty-seven percent of the suspected cases (n = 1,155) were reported since the beginning of January 2020. From 19 January through 15 February 2020, confirmed cases were reported in 18 of the 34 communes of the island. The most affected parts of the island are in the South and Central of Martinique. Results of laboratory tests indicate that DENV-2 and DENV-3 are the predominant serotypes currently circulating.In 2018, Martinique did not report any confirmed cases. The last outbreak reported in Martinique was from 2013 to 2015 with 7,040 suspected cases and no deaths reported. The outbreak was due to DENV-1 which was the predominant circulating serotype.Source: Le point \u00e9pid\u00e9mio, Sant\u00e9 publique France \u2013 Cellule Antilles, 20 February 2020 and reproduced by PAHO/WHOFrom 12 January through 16 February 2020, a total of 530 suspected cases of dengue, including one severe and fatal case, was reported. Results of laboratory tests indicate that serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-3 are currently circulating, with predominance of DENV-1.From 2002 through 2005, DENV-3 was the only serotype in circulation. Between 2006 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-2 (2006, 2009) and DENV-1 (2007, 2008 and 2010) with co-circulation of DENV-3 and DENV-4. In 2013 and 2014, DENV-4 was the predominant serotype.From December 2019 through 15 February 2020, a total of 100 suspected cases of dengue, including 20 cases confirmed by NS1 antigen test and/or RT-PCR, was reported (Figure 4). Laboratory tests identified DENV-1 and DENV-2 as the circulating serotypes.The last outbreak reported in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy was from 2013 to 2014 with 970 suspected cases and one death reported. The outbreak was due to DENV-4 which was the predominant circulating serotype; with co-circulation of DENV-2. DENV-1 was identified during the 2009/2010 outbreak.Source: Le point \u00e9pid\u00e9mio, Sant\u00e9 publique France \u2013 Cellule Antilles, 20 February 2020 and reproduced by PAHO/WHOHealth authorities in French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin, and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy are implementing the following measures:The Caribbean islands have a tropical climate. There are two main seasons: a wet season from June to November and a dry season from December to May.French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy have been reporting dengue cases throughout 2020; however, an increase was observed towards the end of 2019.In Guadeloupe and Martinique, cases have exceeded the seasonal threshold since October and November 2019, respectively.A shift in the predominant DENV serotype in these territories may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and may require comprehensive risk communications. Due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that these territories are popular tourist destinations, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and other countries cannot be ruled out.In light of the increase in dengue cases and severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, especially in 2019, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages Member States to follow key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM). These recommendations are published in the\u00a021 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue\u00a0and the\u00a011 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue\u00a0.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate early case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. Deaths from dengue virus disease are often related to a delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases.Additionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, healthcare facilities, and other settings where individuals, families and communities gather to prevent vector-person contact.Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes, the competent vectors, have greater activity during the day. Given this, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Region of the Americas (PAHO)", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON253", "date_of_publication": "2020-03-05", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "No new cases of Ebola virus disease have been reported since 17 February, and on 3 March, the only person confirmed to have EVD in the last 21 days (Figure 1) was discharged from an Ebola Treatment Centre after recovering and testing negative twice for the virus. This is an important milestone in the outbreak. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD, and a critical need to maintain response operations \u2013 as outlined in the\u00a0 WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.As of 3 March 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1927) were female, 28% (n=973) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.WHO\u2019s financial need for the Ebola Response for January to June 2020 (SRP 4.1) is US $83 million. Thanks to the generosity of donors during 2019, WHO had some carry-over funding available, however, WHO now requires US$ 40 million to ensure continuity of activities.Ebola virus may persist in some survivors\u2019 body fluids, with potential to infect others. In at least one instance during this outbreak, relapse was observed, sparking a new chain of transmission which has taken several months to interrupt. At the individual level, people who have recovered from EVD may develop medical and psychological complications. EVD survivors should be offered support when they return to their communities in order to care for any post-EVD complications.In response to these needs, and based on lessons learned from previous outbreaks, a multi-disciplinary follow-up programme for EVD survivor care was initiated just three months after the declaration of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health and the Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB), with the support of the World Health Organization and the World Food Programme. It was the first time a national EVD survivor programme was implemented in the early phase of an EVD outbreak.The programme entails monthly visits to health clinics for at least 18 months to follow up with clinical, biological and psychological aspects of each survivor\u2019s health and well-being. Each month, more than 85% of survivors come to the clinics. This suggests that survivors and their communities accept, trust and have confidence in the programme. In addition, survivors are offered specialized services by trained local professionals, working in close collaboration with survivors\u2019 associations. This includes ophthalmic care, neurological care, psychosocial support, laboratory services, pregnancy management and paediatric care. The programme has continued to adapt with the evolution of the outbreak. Five dedicated clinics are currently operating in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Mangina, and Mambasa.Since the beginning of the outbreak, 1160 people have recovered from EVD. This includes 50 (4%) infants under 1-year-old, 55 (5%) children aged 1 to 4 years old, 145 (13%) children aged 5 to 17, and 910 (78%) adults aged 18 years or older. Of the total survivors, 641 (55%) are female, including eight women that were pregnant at the time of EVD infection, and survived with a viable foetus. To ensure proper pregnancy follow-up and safe delivery, WHO supported the implementation of dedicated care for these women. This is the first time women who were pregnant while sick with EVD have recovered with healthy babies and is a major breakthrough in supporting pregnant women who recovered from EVD.In order to provide appropriate and needed care for EVD survivors it is essential to sustain the programme for at least 18 months after the outbreak is declared over. Furthermore, concerted research efforts are required to better understand and respond to survivor needs. WHO will support INRB and partners in these endeavours.*Excludes n=153 cases for whom onset dates not reported.

The first case of measles was recorded in week 5 of 2019 (week commencing 28 January 2019) and the outbreak has continued through to week 7 of 2020 (week commencing 10 February 2020), with eighteen health districts affected including twelve newly affected in 2020 (Bimbo, B\u00e9goua, Bangui I, Bangui II and Bangui III in the urban area, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Baboua-Abba, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, and Ouango-Gambo in the rural area).From 1 January 2019 through 16 February 2020, a total of 7,626 suspected cases including 83 deaths (case fatality rate 1.08%) were reported. A large proportion of cases (72%) were below five years old and 18% of cases were between 5 and 10 years old. A total of 1,167 samples from suspected cases were tested at the reference laboratory of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, of which 180 were positive for measles using Immunoglobulin M (IgM).The low vaccination coverage for routine measles vaccine over the past 5 years (below 60% for the first dose at 9 months), the absence of a second measles vaccine dose in the national immunization schedule, and inadequate follow-up campaigns resulted in a high proportion of people susceptible to measles, contributing to the ongoing epidemic. All 35 health districts are at risk of a measles outbreak, and without adequate response, the epidemic could spread through the entire country. The number of districts affected by the measles outbreak is increasing, and as of 1 March 2020, 15 health districts have been affected: Alindao, Alindao-Mingala, Baboua-Abba, Bambari, Bangui I, Bangui II, Bangui III, B\u00e9goua, Bimbo, Bococaranga-Koui, Boss\u00e9mb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bouar, Bozoum, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, Ngaoundaye, and Ouango-Gambo.In December 2019, outbreaks affected eight health districts, and the country organized local measles vaccination campaigns that targeted children aged 6 to 59 months in seven districts (Bambari, Batangafo, Bocaranga-Koui, Grimari-Kouango, K\u00e9mo, Ngaoundaye, and Nana-Gribizi). Despite vaccination coverage of more than 95%, as confirmed by the vaccination coverage survey, new cases are being recorded in these districts and neighboring health districts in children aged from 5 to 15 years old. Based on the age distribution of cases as indicated by epidemiological investigations, the proposed vaccination strategy is to target the risk group from 6 months to 10 years to help stop transmission.Since the official declaration of the outbreak by Ministry of Health on 24 January 2020, the following public health actions have been conducted:WHO estimates the overall risk for the CAR from the current measles outbreak to be \u201chigh\u201d due to the following reasons:Risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the large cross border movements of populations to and from neighboring countries including Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, both for security reasons and commercial activities.The risk is considered low at the global level.Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and two doses of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV) are recommended to ensure immunity.WHO urges all Member States to:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Central African Republic", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON252", "date_of_publication": "2020-02-27", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "From 19 to 25 February, no new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported. This was the first time since the beginning of the response that no new confirmed cases were reported over a seven-day period (Figure 1). The most recent case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province on 17 February. While the lack of new confirmed cases reported in the last seven days is a major achievement, the outbreak remains active and risk of additional cases emerging remains high. In the past 21 days (5 to 25 February 2020), four confirmed cases were reported from two health areas in Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1). Even with strengthened surveillance operations, transmission of Ebola virus outside of groups currently under surveillance cannot be excluded. Ebola virus also persists in some survivors\u2019 body fluids, with potential to infect others. In at least one instance during this outbreak, relapse \u2013 in which a person who has recovered from EVD develops symptoms again \u2013 was observed, sparking a new chain of transmission which has taken several months to interrupt. To mitigate a potential resurgence of the outbreak, it is critical to maintain response capacities to rapidly detect and respond to any new cases, and to prioritize survivor support and monitoring and the maintenance of cooperative relationships with the survivors\u2019 associations.Substantial surveillance, pathogen detection, and clinical management activities are currently ongoing, including validating alerts, following remaining contacts who were potentially exposed to the virus, supporting rapid diagnostics of suspected cases, and working with community members to strengthen surveillance on people who pass away in the communities. As of 25 February, 510 contacts are currently under surveillance, of which 97% were followed daily in the last seven days. In the last seven days, more than 5100 alerts per day were reported and investigated, of which over 400 alerts (including ~70 community deaths) were validated as suspected EVD cases; requiring laboratory testing and specialized care within the established Ebola treatment and transit centres. On average, suspect cases stay in these facilities for three days before EVD can be definitively ruled out (i.e. after two negative polymerase chain reaction tests 48 hours apart), while care is provided for their illness under isolation precautions. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided across 11 operational laboratories deployed in cities that have been affected by the outbreak. From 17 to 23 February, more than 3600 samples were tested.To maintain operations and prevent potential resurgence of the outbreak, WHO requires further funding.

The cases were reported from Aseer (7 cases), Riyadh (6 cases), Al-Qassim (2 cases), Eastern (2 cases), Madinah (1 case), and Aljouf (1 case) regions. In January 2020, a hospital outbreak was reported in Aseer region with a cluster of 6 cases. Three of the cases were health care workers, two were patients and one was a visitor. One of the cases of this cluster died on 4 February 2020.The link below provides details of the 19 reported cases:\u00a0MERS-CoV cases reported from 1 December 2019 through 31 January 2020From 2012 until 31 January 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2519 with 866 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON250", "date_of_publication": "2020-02-22", "headline": "Dengue Fever - Chile", "main_text": "On 7 February 2020, the Chile IHR National Focal Point informed the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) of the detection of three confirmed cases of autochthonous dengue fever reported on Easter Island. The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020.These are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.In 2000, the presence of the vector,\u00a0A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.Since 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.The density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.Actions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:Dengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.The introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.Easter Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5\u00b0C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7\u00b0C. Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28\u00b0C and minimum temperature of 15\u00b0C.Easter Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.In light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the\u00a021 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue\u00a0and the\u00a011 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue.There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.Additionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.Given that\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Chile", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON249", "date_of_publication": "2020-02-21", "headline": "Yellow Fever - Uganda", "main_text": "From 4 November through 14 February 2020, eight laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever in Buliisa (3), Maracha (1) and Moyo (4); including four deaths (CFR 50%), were detected through the national surveillance system.On 10 December 2019, the Ministry of Health (MoH) was notified by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Regional Reference Laboratory of a case of yellow fever confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The case was a 37-year-old male with suspected viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). His occupation was cattle farming with a history of travel to trade milk between Kizikya cell, Buliisa district in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). On 30 October 2019, he presented to hospital with symptoms of fever and headache of a five-day duration. His symptoms worsened with vomiting, abdominal pain and epistaxis and he died on 4 November 2019. During an in-depth investigation in December, eight samples were collected from close contacts, including family members and neighbours, and tested for yellow fever. On 22 January 2020, UVRI notified the MoH of a second case of yellow fever confirmed by serological testing (IgM and PRNT) in Buliisa with connection to the index case and with similar occupation. The other samples collected during investigation were negative for yellow fever.Two other confirmed cases of yellow fever were identified in Moyo district in West Nile region which shares a border with South Sudan. The cases were aged 18 and 21 years, traded timber between Uganda and South Sudan and spent time in both countries. Onset of illness for both cases was 3 January 2020 and they were admitted at a Health Center in Moyo District. They were later referred to a General Hospital with symptoms of fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, headache, abdominal and joint pains, confusion and unexplained bleeding. The cases deteriorated and died in the hospital on 5 and 6 January 2020. Results from UVRI confirmed yellow fever infection by RT-PCR performed at UVRI.Subsequently, Moyo district notified a second cluster of suspected and confirmed yellow fever infection in a different village. The confirmed case in the suspected cluster was a 59-year-old patient who presented with symptoms including unexplained bleeding and fever on 22 January and died on 23 January 2020. A blood sample collected tested positive for yellow fever by RT-PCR at UVRI. His death was preceded by the death of two of his family members in early January with similar symptoms.The Minister of Health of the Government of Uganda declared an outbreak of yellow fever on 23 January 2020.Subsequent to the declaration of an outbreak, three additional cases were confirmed in Buliisa (1), Moyo (1) and Maracha (1). Detailed investigations of these cases are ongoing.National rapid response teams have been deployed to Moyo and Buliisa districts to conduct further investigations, and initiate outbreak response. Other response activities include: enhanced surveillance and active case finding in all districts in the north-west region, and entomological surveys in the affected districts of Buliisa and Moyo. Cross-border notification with South Sudan in reference to the cases in Moyo district has been done. Investigations are ongoing in DRC and South Sudan and WHO AFRO is supporting coordination.The Ministry of Health is planning a reactive campaign, approved by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control. This reactive campaign will target approximately 1.7 million people to stop transmission and prevent imminent risk of the outbreak spreading in the north-west part of country particularly in Buliisa, Koboko, Maracha, Moyo and Yumbe districts. To achieve sustained protection across the country, the MoH is preparing to apply for the introduction of yellow fever vaccination into the routine immunization programme in 2021 and implementation of preventive mass vaccination campaigns nationally.Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. Uganda is classified as a high-risk country in the \u201cEliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics\u201d (EYE) initiative, with history of recent outbreaks in 2019, 2018, 2016 and 2011. Epidemic spread of yellow fever is a risk in Uganda as the estimated overall population immunity is low (4.2%), and attributable to past reactive vaccination activities in focal districts that are not affected by the current outbreak.Due to the negligible population immunity in the affected districts, the detection of yellow fever cases is concerning. The affected districts share international borders with both DRC and South Sudan; and are marked by frequent population movements and high interconnectivity. Population immunity for yellow fever in the cross-border areas is also low and the forest biome between countries is continuous, indicating that there is a risk of international spread. Close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing is needed as the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries and risk of onward spreading to DRC and South Sudan cannot be completely excluded.Vaccination is the primary means for prevention and control of yellow fever and provides immunity for life. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. The country plans to introduce yellow fever vaccination into the routine immunization program and complete preventive mass vaccination activities to rapidly boost population immunity. Expedited planning and implementation of these activities to protect the population will help avert risk of future outbreaks.WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers aged 9 months and above going to Uganda as there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. However yellow fever vaccination is not recommended for infants aged 6 to 8 months, except during epidemics when the risk of yellow fever virus transmission may be very high. The risks and benefits of vaccination in this age group should be carefully considered before vaccination. The vaccine should be used with caution during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, pregnant or breastfeeding women may be vaccinated during epidemics or if travel to a country or area with risk of transmission is unavoidable. Uganda also requires, as a condition of entry, a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate for travellers aged 1 year and above.In accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) Third Edition, the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever is valid from 10 days after vaccination and throughout the life of the person vaccinated. A single dose of WHO approved yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and is not required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. As a general precaution, WHO also recommends avoidance of mosquito bites. The highest risk for transmission of yellow fever virus is during the day and early evening. Travellers should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of yellow fever and instructed to rapidly seek medical advice if experiencing signs and symptoms suggestive of yellow fever infection. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where a competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and trade to Uganda on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Uganda", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON245", "date_of_publication": "2020-02-20", "headline": "Lassa Fever - Nigeria", "main_text": "From 1 January through 9 February 2020, 472 laboratory confirmed cases including 70 deaths (case fatality ratio= 14.8%) have been reported in 26 out of 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory. Of the 472 confirmed cases, 75% have been reported from three states: Edo (167 cases), Ondo (156 cases) and Ebonyi (30 cases). The other states that have reported cases include : Taraba (25), Bauchi (14), Plateau (13), Kogi (13), Delta (12), Nasarawa (4), Kano (4), Rivers (4), Enugu (4), Borno (3), Kaduna (3), Katsina (3), Benue (2), Adamawa (2), Sokoto (2), Osun (2), Abia (2), Kebbi (2), Gombe (1), Oyo (1), Anambra (1), FCT (1), and Ogun (1).Fifteen confirmed cases have been reported among health care workers with one death among a confirmed case and one among a probable case.Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the annual peak of human cases is usually observed during the dry season (December\u2013April) following the reproduction cycle of the Mastromy rats in the wet season (May \u2013 June). Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure to (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats\u2019 urine and faeces) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in young non-immune rat population during the wet season create a potential for further human infection, thus, the number of infections is expected to continue to rise until the end of the dry season.Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health care settings.About 80% of persons infected with the Lassa virus are asymptomatic but in the remaining 20%, the illness manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio is usually between 1% and 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, but may exist in other West African countries.Although Nigeria is a Lassa fever endemic country and has developed capacity for managing Lassa fever outbreaks, the current overall risk is considered moderate at national level. Capacities at sub-national level remain suboptimal. Fifteen confirmed cases have been reported among healthcare workers in this outbreak and highlights the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures. Furthermore, country capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks needs to be improved (surveillance, laboratory, case management, coordination and IPC measures).The overall regional and global risk is considered to be low due to minimal number of suspected cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighboring countries.Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good \u201ccommunity hygiene\u201d to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households. Mastomys, an African genus of rodents are so abundant in endemic areas, it is not possible to completely eliminate them from the environment. Family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons.In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials) and safe injection practices.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within one metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).WHO continues to advise all countries endemic for Lassa fever on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality ratio.WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Nigeria and the affected areas based on the currently available information.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Lassa Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Nigeria", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON248", "date_of_publication": "2020-02-20", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "During the past week, the incidence of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has remained low (Figure 1). From 12 to 18 February, one new confirmed case was reported. The case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case reported on 5 February. As the case was alerted and transferred to an Ebola Treated Centre four days after symptom onset, there remains a risk that onward transmission to contacts may have occurred, and further cases may be expected from the currently active chain of transmission. Ebola virus may also persist in some survivors\u2019 body fluids for several months, and in a limited number of instances, transmissions from exposure to body fluids of survivors have been documented during this outbreak. The ongoing programme for survivor care helps mitigate the risks of re-introduction events.To maintain operations and prevent re-emergence of the outbreak, WHO is requesting funding. Under the Strategic Response Plan (SRP 4.1), WHO\u2019s financial need for the Ebola Response from January to June 2020 is US $83 million. Thanks to the generosity of many donors during 2019, WHO has some carry-over funding, which has been applied to maintain operations through February 2020. USD $40 million is currently needed to ensure continuity of response and preparedness activities to bring the case incidence to zero, and continue building strong, resilient health systems.In the past 21 days (29 January to 18 February 2020), eight confirmed cases were reported from four health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=7) and Mabalako (n=1).

All three cases have epidemiological links to a transmission chain originating in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone, with possible nosocomial exposure in Beni. The most recent case reported from Beni Health Zone on 11 February was isolated one day after symptom onset. Early detection of cases reduces the probability of transmission of EVD in the community and significantly improves the clinical outcome for the patients.In the past 21 days (22 January to 11 February 2020), 12 confirmed cases, including three community deaths, were reported from four health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=11) and Mabalako (n=1).

All four cases were reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province. Three cases had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone, and their most likely exposure was through nosocomial infection in traditional practitioner facilities. The fourth and most recent case reported in Beni Health Zone was not a known contact at the time of detection, stayed in the community for nine days after symptom onset, and passed away in the community on 4 February. Confirmed cases who spend time in the community increase the risk of transmission of EVD to contacts.In the past 21 days (15 January to 4 February January 2020), 18 confirmed cases, including three community deaths, were reported from three health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=17) and Mabalako (n=1). The reduction of geographic spread of EVD cases and the declining trend in case incidence observed in the past 21 days are encouraging. In addition, monthly surveillance indicators have overall improved since October 2019. These indicators include an increase in proportion of cases registered as contacts, a decrease in the proportion of community deaths among new reported cases, a decrease in delay to isolation, and a decrease in the monthly case fatality ratio.These improvements are fragile and should not be interpreted as an indication that response efforts can be reduced. Among the 18 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, nine cases were isolated and provided care three or more days after symptom onset, which increases the possibility of community transmission.

Since then, UAE has reported 91 cases of MERS-CoV (including these cases) and 12 associated deaths. From 2012 until 15 January 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2506 with 862 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Upon identification of these above-mentioned cases, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation included screening of all close contacts, including occupational contacts in the two farms, household contacts and healthcare workers at the health care facilities. All close contacts have been tested for MERS-CoV and the results are negative. All of them have been monitored on a daily basis for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed cases. The veterinary authorities have been notified and investigation in animals is ongoing.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON242", "date_of_publication": "2020-01-30", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "From 22 to 28 January five new confirmed cases were reported in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All five cases were reported from Beni Health Zone and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. The most likely exposure for all these cases was through nosocomial infection in traditional practitioner facilities. All of the cases were identified as contacts but were not followed up at the time of detection.One confirmed case reported on 20 January stayed in the community for four days prior to being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) and infected two additional people in the community. These two individuals, reported on 27 January, stayed four to five days in the community while symptomatic prior to isolation. One other confirmed case stayed in the community for eight days after symptom onset and passed away in the community on 28 January. Confirmed cases who spend time in the community increase the risk of transmission of EVD to contacts. Therefore, further cases can be expected in the coming two weeks in Bundji and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas and neighbouring health areas in Beni Health Zone.In the past 21 days (8 to 28 January 2020), 28 confirmed cases were reported from five health areas within three active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=18), Mabalako (n=9), and Musienene (n=1). Beni Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 64% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. As of 28 January, the following health zones marked more than 21 days without confirmed cases of EVD: Mambasa Health Zone in Ituri Province (23 days), and Butembo (25 days) Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Of the 28 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 20 were isolated and provided care within the first two days after symptom onset, which means that they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community.In the past 21 days encouraging trends about the development of the outbreak have been observed. The past epidemiological week (20 to 26 January 2020) saw the smallest number of cases reported since the beginning of the response; cases have been reported in five health areas in three health zones; contact tracing performance as well as the daily number of reported alerts continue to improve over time (Figure 3, Figure 4). Contact tracing has notably improved as a result of the provision of accommodation and essential services in Beni Health Zone to known contacts who have agreed to be followed. Despite these encouraging signs, continuous vigilance is warranted in order to overcome remaining challenges. Possible nosocomial transmission linked to traditional practitioner facilities remains a major driver of the current outbreak and poses specific challenges such as contact identification.As of 28 January, a total of 3421 EVD cases were reported, including 3302 confirmed and 119 probable cases, of which 2242 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1918) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases were health care workers.**3421 confirmed and probable cases, reported as of 28 January 2020.

All of the cases were reported from Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Eight of the cases (8/9) were registered contacts prior to symptom onset; all nine had epidemiological links to a confirmed case.In the past 21 days (1 to 21 January 2020), 35 confirmed cases were reported from 11 health areas within five active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=14), Mabalako (n=11), Butembo (n=5), Mambasa (n=4), and Musienene (n=1). Beni and Mabalako Health Zones remain the current hotspots of the outbreak, having reported 71% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Of the 35 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 24 were isolated and provided care within the first two days after the onset of symptoms, meaning they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community. In the past 21 days, only one confirmed EVD death occurred in the community, outside of an Ebola treatment centre.In recent weeks, contacts of confirmed cases have been offered the option of staying in supportive accommodation allocated for identified EVD contacts where they are provided with food and other essential goods. This allows for systematic daily follow-up of contacts and enables prompt isolation and provision of care to contacts that become symptomatic. As a result, the median time to isolation in the past 21 days has decreased from three days to one day (interquartile range 0-3).The number of new confirmed cases reported each week has remained stable over the past six weeks, with approximately 14 new EVD cases reported weekly. In addition, improved surveillance indicators such as the proportion of cases listed as contacts and followed prior to detection, and the decreased time to isolation of cases are encouraging signs.As of 21 January, a total of 3416 EVD cases were reported, including 3297 confirmed and 119 probable cases, of which 2238 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1912) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.As of 21 January, the current transmission chain is comprised of 82 confirmed and probable cases reported in 13 health areas in six health zones; Mabalako, Beni, Biena, Butembo, Katwa, and Musienene Health Zones. The transmission chain originated from one individual who was classified as a relapse of EVD in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone (first reported in the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News published on 19 December 2019). The individual, which is the first and only case of relapse documented in this outbreak, was infected in June 2019, relapsed in November, and passed away in December.Further analyses indicate that the individual directly infected 29 people while symptomatic in the community for nine days before being isolated. Of the cases who were directly infected from this case, 11/29 were through possible nosocomial transmission. The remaining 52 cases resulted from onward transmissions.Based on available information regarding the place of exposure for cases in this transmission chain, the main drivers are individuals exposed in the community due to delays to case isolation (50%, 41/82), possible nosocomial transmission (37%, 30/82), and community deaths where cases were exposed during funerals (2%, 2/82). The estimated reproduction number (R), which is the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a susceptible population, of this transmission chain was not statistically significantly different from the overall mean R of this outbreak, likely due to the limited sample size of cases in the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area. These findings reinforce the importance of early identification of cases and safe and dignified burials.*3416 confirmed and probable cases, reported as of 21 January 2020.

She visited a local hospital in Wuhan and was initially diagnosed with a cold. On 19 January , the case-patient was detected with fever (38.3 \u00b0C) upon arrival at the Incheon International Airport. The case-patient was transferred to a national designated isolation hospital for testing and treatment. She was tested positive for pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and subsequently was confirmed positive for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on 20 January by sequencing at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Upon detection, the patient had chills, runny nose, and muscle pain.The case-patient did not report visiting any markets, including Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, nor did she have known contact with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases or wild animals in Wuhan city.The case-patient is currently under isolation, receiving treatment and is in a stable condition.This is the fourth internationally exported case of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan City, China by travelers. Since the initial report of cases on 31 December 2019, and as of 20 January 2020, 278 laboratory-confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection including six deaths were reported to WHO globally from China, two cases from Thailand, one case from Japan, and one case from the Republic of Korea. In China, 51 are severe cases, and 12 cases are critically ill. They are all under isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. Among the cases reported in China, 14 cases have been reported from Guangdong province, five from Beijing municipality and one from Shanghai municipality.The source of the outbreak is still under investigation in Wuhan City. Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for nCoV in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, however some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market. Cases continue to be reported from Wuhan City, and from other provinces in China. Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.It is prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections by following the below mentioned measures:WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.

All new confirmed cases (100%, 14/14) reported in the past seven days were registered contacts prior to symptom onset and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated from Aloya Health Area in Mabalako Health Zone.In the past 21 days (25 December 2019 to 14 January 2020), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 14 health areas within seven active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (43%,\u00a0n=17), Butembo (20%,\u00a0n=8), Beni (13%,\u00a0n=5), Mambasa (10%,\u00a0n=4), Kalunguta (8%,\u00a0n=3), Katwa (5%,\u00a0n=2), and Musienene (3%,\u00a0n=1). Mabalako Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 43% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. The majority of cases (88%, 35/40) reported from this period are linked to known chains of transmission, which is similar to the period from 4 to 24 December 2019 (89%, 47/53). In the past 21 days, 8% (3/36) of the confirmed EVD deaths were people who died in the community, outside of Ebola treatment centres. From these three community deaths, 15 additional cases occurred, which reinforces the need for continued activities to follow contacts, detect symptomatic patients as early as possible, and engage communities in response efforts.As of 14 January, a total of 3406 EVD cases were reported, including 3288 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2236 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1).

In Kalunguta Health Zone, North Kivu Province, where five individuals were confirmed with EVD from 24 to 28 December 2019, all 153 contacts have cleared their 21-day follow-up, with no new cases reported. In Mambasa Health Zone, Ituri Province, where four new cases were reported from 4 to 5 January 2020, more than 400 followed contacts are nearing the end of their high-risk period.It has been more than 17 months since the outbreak was first declared on 1 August 2018. The number of cases reported per week is lower than the period from March to September 2019 (Figure 1). However, there are several health areas which are difficult to reach due to insecurity, including Mandima Health Zone, where there are rumours of several community deaths in Lwemba Health Area.

The traveler with febrile illness was detected on the same day by thermal surveillance at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), Thailand, and was hospitalized the same day. After temperature check and initial assessment, she was transferred to the hospital for further investigations and treatment.The patient\u2019s full exposure history is under investigation. She reported a history of visiting a local fresh market in Wuhan on regular basis prior to the onset of illness on 5 January 2020; however, she did not report visiting the Huanan South China Seafood Market from where most of the cases were detected. Samples tested positive for coronaviruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 12 January 2020. The genomic sequencing analysis performed by Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center, the Thai Red Cross Society (EID-TRC) and the Thai National Institute of Health (Thai NIH), Department of Medical Sciences confirmed that the patient was infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was isolated in Wuhan, China (for more information, please see the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020\u00a0).As of this writing, the patient is in a stable condition and in hospital.The Ministry of Public Health Thailand implemented measures for screening travelers from Wuhan city on 3 January 2020 at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang, Phuket and Chiang Mai airports, and activated enhanced surveillance at public and private hospitals. Since the identification of the case on 5 January 2019, Thai health authorities have taken the following measures:The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand has international-standard diagnosis and medical care, and is closely coordinating with WHO and related departments for the potential response measures.This is the first exported case of novel coronavirus from Wuhan city, China. Since the initial report of cases in Wuhan city on 31 December 2019, 41 cases have a preliminary diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, including 1 death in a person with severe underlying medical conditions (for more information, please see the\u00a0Disease Outbreak News published on 12 January 2020\u00a0).As the traveler did not report having visited the market linked to most of the other cases, it is vital that investigations continue to identify the source of infection. To date, China has not reported any cases of infection among healthcare workers or contacts of the cases. Based on the available information there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020 in China.Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected. It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans.Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.WHO has provided\u00a0interim guidance for novel coronaviruses\u00a0.WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Thailand based on the information currently available on this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Novel Coronavirus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Thail", "location": ""}, {"country": "(ex-China)", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON233", "date_of_publication": "2020-01-12", "headline": "COVID-19 - China", "main_text": "On 11 and 12 January 2020, WHO received further detailed information from the National Health Commission about the outbreak.WHO is reassured of the quality of the ongoing investigations and the response measures implemented in Wuhan, and the commitment to share information regularly.The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan. The market was closed on 1 January 2020. At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission. The Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance and follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations.Among the 41 confirmed cases, there has been one death. This death occurred in a patient with serious underlying medical conditions.China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus on 12 January, which will be of great importance for other countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.The cluster was initially reported on 31 December 2019, when the WHO China Country Office was informed. The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV), which was isolated on 7 January 2020. Laboratory testing was conducted on all suspected cases identified through active case finding and retrospective review. Other respiratory pathogens such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were ruled out as the cause.According to information conveyed to WHO by Chinese authorities on 11 and 12 January, 41 cases with novel coronavirus infection have been preliminarily diagnosed in Wuhan City. Of the 41 cases reported, seven are severely ill. This is when the one death, mentioned above, was reported, in a patient with other underlying health conditions. Six patients have been discharged from hospital. Symptom onset of the 41 confirmed nCoV cases ranges from 8 December 2019 to 2 January 2020. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020.The clinical signs and symptoms reported are mainly fever, with a few cases having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive pneumonic infiltrates in both lungs. National authorities report that patients have been isolated and are receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions.According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers and frequent visitors to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.Currently, no case with infection of this novel coronavirus has been reported elsewhere other than Wuhan.China's National Health Commission has deployed a group of experts to Wuhan City to support the local response.National authorities have reported the following response measures:WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in regular contact with national authorities in China to provide support required. Technical guidance on novel coronavirus has been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information is available.To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak.Wuhan city is a major domestic and international transport hub. To date, there have been no reported cases outside of Wuhan City.More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection; as well as the countermeasures implemented.Based on information provided by national authorities, WHO\u2019s recommendations on public health measures and surveillance for novel coronaviruses apply.WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their healthcare provider.

He developed fever, cough and sore throat on 8 December 2019 and was admitted to hospital on 10 December, then transferred to ICU on 16 December. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (UpE and Orf1a genes) on 16 December by the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory. He has underlying comorbidities including hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, heart disease, asthma and hypertension. He has a history of close contact with dromedary camels and sheep at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He has no history of recent travel and has not been involved in slaughtering animals. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in intensive care unit isolation.Since 2012, UAE has reported 89 cases of MERS-CoV (including this case) and 12 associated deaths. From 2012 through 29 December 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2494 with 858 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Upon identification of the patient, an incident report, case investigation and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts, including occupational contacts in his farm, household contacts and healthcare workers at the hospital where he sought care. All identified contacts of the confirmed case will be monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed case.A total of 88 contacts have been identified, including 70 health care contacts and 18 household contacts. All close contacts of the patient were tested negative for MERS-CoV.The veterinary authorities have been notified and investigations for MERS-CoV in animals are ongoing.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["MERS-CoV"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Arab Emirates", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON229", "date_of_publication": "2020-01-05", "headline": "COVID-19 - China", "main_text": "On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.

The patient is a 5-year-old child from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who travelled with his family from Mabalako Health Zone in Democratic Republic of the Congo after attending, on 1 June 2019, the funeral of his grandfather (confirmed EVD case on 2 June 2019). On 10 June 2019, the child and the family entered the country through Bwera border post and sought medical care at Kagando hospital where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness. The child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) for management. The confirmation of Ebola Virus was made on 11 June 2019 at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), and the child has deceased in the early hours of 12 June 2019. Two other suspected cases, a 50-year-old female (grandmother of the first case) and 3-year-old male (younger brother of the first case) part of the family members who travelled together with the first confirmed child were also admitted in the same ETU and were confirmed for EVD by UVRI on 12 June 2019. The 50 year-old-female died during the night between 12 and 13 June. 27 other contacts have been identified and are being monitored. Healthcare workers from both health care facilities where the child was treated have been previously vaccinated.All three confirmed cases are imported from Democratic Republic of the Congo and belong to the same family who travelled together from Mabalako Health Zone, an area currently affected by Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, they remain as a single episode of EVD in Uganda, and the geographical spread in Uganda appears to be limited to one district near Democratic Republic of the Congo border. Further investigations are ongoing both in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo to assess the full extent of the outbreak.Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 2018, WHO has advised neighbouring countries (Priority 1 countries: Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi / Priority 2 countries: Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo) to reinforce their preparedness measures.Considering that to date i) the EVD cases confirmed in Uganda were epidemiologically linked to the Democratic Republic of the Congo; ii) all three cases belong to single family cluster with a common high-risk exposure to a confirmed case, iii) the level of preparedness and the proven experience of Ugandan authorities to manage previous EVD outbreaks, and iv) the rapidity of the detection and a limited geographical area affected (Kasese district), the overall level of risk at national level is assessed as moderate. Moreover, given that there is no evidence of local transmission of EVD in Uganda and the location of the outbreak being close to the Democratic Republic of the Congo border, the overall risk posed at regional level by the Ugandan outbreak is considered low. However, the overall regional risk posed by the outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo remains very high. The overall risk at international level remains low.The Director-General will convene a third meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) following the most recent risk assessment which noted a cross-border spread of Ebola from Democratic Republic of the Congo to Uganda. WHO has convened the emergency committee under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) twice (October 2018 and April 2019) since the outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo was announced in August. The committee will discuss whether the event constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Uganda based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place.For more information, please see:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola Virus Disease"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Uganda", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/13-june-2019-ebola-drc-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-06-13", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "13 June 2019The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases in hotspots such as Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta health zones. However, in other areas such as Mabalako and Butembo, moderate rates of transmission continue. With ongoing EVD transmission within communities in 12 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, factors such as persistent delays in case detection, approximately a third of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment or transit centres, and high population mobility, pose a high risk of geographical spread both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries. This was highlighted by the recent exportation of cases to Uganda \u2013 the first confirmed cases detected outside of North Kivu and Ituri province since the onset of the outbreak over 10 months ago. For more information, please see Disease Outbreak News on EVD in UgandaWeekly decrease in the incidence of new cases have been reported in several health zones; however, increase or a continuation of the outbreak has been observed in others (Figure 1). In the 21 days, between 22 May to 11 June 2019, 62 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 212 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (33%, n=69), Butembo (18%, n=39), Katwa (14%, n=30) Mandima (11%, n=23) and Beni (9%, n=20). Single confirmed cases were also reported from Rwampara and Komanda health zones this past week following a prolonged period since the last reported case, with both cases acquiring the infection in the aforementioned hotspots.As of 11 June 2019, a total of 2084 EVD cases, including 1990 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1405 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1311 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2084 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1194) were female, and 29% (605) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 118 (6% of total cases).Taking these recent events into consideration, the WHO Director-General will convene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on 14 June 2019. The independent group of public health experts will provide their views to the Director-General on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). If the event is determined to constitute a PHEIC, the Director-General will issue Temporary Recommendations, which are usually health measures aimed at reducing the international spread of Ebola and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. A statement giving an account of the meeting and its conclusions will be posted on the WHO website immediately after the meeting.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower though still substantial rates since then. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. In order to ensure staff safety and security, security mitigation measures are being enhanced, and procedural, operational, and physical security challenges are being addressed. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up.WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, please see:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/06-june-2019-polio-cameroon-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-06-06", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Cameroon", "main_text": "6 June 2019On 23 May 2019, WHO received notification through the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from an environmental sample collected on 20 April 2019 in a hospital in Northern Cameroon which borders Borno state in Nigeria and Chad. In this region, the vaccine coverage in 2018 for inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV1) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3) was 73% and 72% respectively. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only \u2013 no associated cases of paralysis have been detected so far.Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolate is associated with the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in neighboring Nigeria which originated in Jigawa state and spread to other areas of Nigeria, as well as internationally to the Republic of Niger in 2018.The Ministry of Health and local health authorities have been involved in the response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria and across the the Lake Chad sub region (Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria) by providing monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2). A thorough investigation of the incident is ongoing with the support of partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and includes assessing the extent of circulation of this strain, identifying sub-national immunity gaps and supporting efforts to strengthen sub-national surveillance sensitivity.This event highlights the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 from Nigeria and the rest of the Lake Chad region, given the large-scale population movement; subnational immunity and surveillance gaps across the Lake Chad region. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation and risk assessment by national authorities.It is important that all countries, particularly those reporting frequent travel to polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect imported cases and facilitate a rapid response. All countries should maintain a high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the impact of new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC which requires an outbreak of poliovirus to be declared as a national public health emergency and all international travellers to be vaccinated. Likewise, countries with the risk of exporting poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Cameroon", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/06-june-2019-ebola-drc-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-06-06", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "6 June 2019As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past two weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% three weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the first week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging. Nevertheless, both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.However, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak may be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 4\u20139 days in the past 3 weeks), with about a third (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside of ETCs. Collectively these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high.In the 21 days between 15 May to 4 June 2019, 80 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 12% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 280 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (27%, n=75), Butembo (23%, n=63), Katwa (16%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=30), Kalunguta (8%, n=23), Mandima (7%, n=19) and Musienene (5%, n=14) health zones.As of 4 June 2019, a total of 2025 EVD cases, including 1931 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1357 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1263 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2025 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1170) were female, and 29% (589) were children aged less than 18 years.

Over the past seven days, a total of 73 new confirmed cases were reported compared to the previous where 127 new confirmed cases were reported. This should be interpreted with caution given the complex operating environment and fragility of the security situation. Katwa, one of the epicenters of the outbreak, reported fewer cases this week and other health zones such as Mabalako, Kalunguta and Mandima have also seen a decline in case reporting. Active transmission was reported in 14 of the 22 health zones that have been affected to date. Other initial encouraging findings such as a lower proportion of reported nosocomial infections, a lower proportion of community deaths and a higher proportion of registered contacts at case detection have also been reported. Weekly fluctuations in these indicators have been reported in the past and uncertainties remain with regards to the ability of the surveillance system to identify all new cases in areas faced with ongoing insecurity. Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high.Mabalako reported 24% (73/309) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Nine out of the 12 Mabalako health areas have reported new confirmed cases during this period. In the 21 days between 8 to 28 May 2019, 83 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 46% of the 180 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 309 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (24%, n=73), Butembo (21%, n=64), Katwa (14%, n=42), Beni (11%, n=34), Kalunguta (10%, n=31), Musienene (7%, n=23) and Mandima (6%, n=20) health zones.As of 28 May 2019, a total of 1945 EVD cases, including 1851 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1302 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1208 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1945 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1122) were female, and 29% (572) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 108 (6% of total cases).All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. On 3 June, a pilgrimage is planned to Namugongo, Uganda to commemorate the death of Catholics and Anglican martyrs. Preparedness activities surrounding the pilgrimage are ongoing.WHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help reveal any gaps and drive evidence-based response improvements. An in-depth analysis of EVD cases in children under five-years of age demonstrated some noteworthy trends. As of 28 May, children under the age of five accounted for 15% (300/1949) of EVD cases reported, with children under one year of age accounting for 6% (118/1949). Of the 300 cases in children under the age of five, 19 were probable cases (19/94, 20% of all probable cases).Data indicate that children under the age of five are being brought into healthcare facilities sooner than cases over the age of five (2.4 days vs. 3.2 days respectively), but most of these cases are not being referred to ETCs, and instead attend multiple local healthcare facilities. These cases visited on average 1.5 healthcare facilities, compared to 1.2 healthcare facilities for cases aged over five-years of age. These observations show that in general, parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities but are reluctant to bringing their children to ETCs, perhaps out of fear of being far from home and without the support of family members. More work needs to be done to reduce fear and misunderstanding of ETCs and to reduce any other barriers to access, with a special focus on this age group. All cases that may not be adequately isolated including children under five-years of age may pose a considerable transmission risk to healthcare workers, patients, and members of the community.With regards to contact-tracing, 28% of EVD cases under five-years of age are registered as contacts, compared to 41% in cases over five-years of age. Although EVD cases under five years of age are less frequently listed as contacts, proportions of cases both below and over five-years of age are under surveillance remain similar (18% vs. 20% respectively). The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing.As of 28 May, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of EVD cases in children under the age of five stands at 77%. This CFR was notably higher than that of EVD cases over five-years of age at 57%. These figures are in line with those observed in the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak1 . There are a number of possible explanations for the higher CFR in this vulnerable population: the lower proportion of cases that present to ETCs, higher baseline mortalities in this population in general, and the inability to vaccinate cases who were not listed as contacts. Community deaths (i.e. any EVD deaths occurring outside of Ebola treatment centres/Transit centres (ETCs/TCs) account for 76% of deaths due to EVD in children under the age of five and 65% above the age of five. Of the community deaths of children under the age of five, 54% died in a healthcare facility.As expected, the CFRs of EVD cases both younger and older than five-years of age (50% and 39% respectively) who sought treatment at ETCs is markedly lower than those who did not (86% and 68% respectively). The relative difference in CFRs between the two groups reduces upon admission into an ETC. This again reinforces the need to continue strengthening efforts to work with communities to encourage all affected populations, and in particular parents of young children, to seek treatment at ETCs as early as possible in order to give them the best chance of survival. Overall, the fact that these observed trends indicate that while it is promising to see lower CFRs in young children treated in ETCs, and to see that parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities, much emphasis needs to be made at improving contact listing of children under five years of age and encouraging parents to bring their children to be treated in ETCs. It must also be stressed that the proportions and resultant associations described above must be interpreted with caution given the often-limited demographic information available and are subject to change due to the fluid nature of the ongoing EVD outbreak.Efforts are ongoing to encourage community-based facilities to refer suspected cases to ETCs/TCs, however these activities can be further strengthened. Children of all ages, including infants, that have suspected or confirmed EVD, are cared for at ETUs with specific optimized, supportive care protocols. Paediatric-specific equipment, medicines and trained specialists are available to provide clinical support at ETCs for this age group. All confirmed children are also rapidly enrolled in investigational therapeutic protocols after informed consent is obtained. Children receive nutritional care and psychosocial support from psychologists while at the ETC and are cared for 24/7 by care providers from survivors so they are not alone. As with all age groups, infants and young children are offered support via a specialized programme of care for Ebola survivors. In addition, pregnant women that have survived EVD are followed closely in the survivor program and return to ETCs for delivery by a multi-disciplinary team that has obstetric and paediatric expertise.In light of these findings, UNICEF and WHO are working with partners in supporting activities related to nutritional care and psychosocial support of EVD patients, particularly for parents and children. These include supporting and providing information related to infant feeding for children separated from their parents or orphaned. UNICEF is working with EVD survivors and creating infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling support groups. They are also supporting the screening of malnourished children under two years old and their referral to Nutritional Units for assistance. Psychosocial support and material assistance are being conducted in outbreak areas where nurseries for children who have been separated from their mothers are set up and psychosocial support is provided to family members accompanying EVD affected persons and their contacts.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.

Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019.

The virus was detected in an environmental sample only, and to date, no associated cases of paralysis have been detected.The subsequent scheduled sewage sample collected from the same site on 4 May 2019 (2 weeks after the positive sample) tested negative for poliovirus.The affected province borders both Baluchistan province in Pakistan, and part of Southern Region in Afghanistan. Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus isolated is most closely linked to WPV1 currently circulating in Karachi region (Sindh province) in Pakistan.The last laboratory-confirmed indigenous wild polio case from the Islamic Republic of Iran was reported in 1997. From 1998-2000, cases of wild poliovirus were imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. No polio cases have been confirmed since 2001. Routine immunization against polio has been mandatory since 1984. Highly organized and well-implemented national immunization days were held during the period from 1994 to 1998. Since 1999, supplementary immunization activities in high-risk areas and populations including province of Sistan-Baluchistan are conducted annually.The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. The findings reconfirmed that immunization and surveillance systems in the Islamic Republic of Iran are strong.WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV-1 from the Islamic Republic of Iran to be low. The risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran\u2019s very high levels of routine immunization coverage for OPV3 (3 doses of oral polio vaccine), estimated at 99%, and strong disease surveillance.However, this event reinforces the importance of implementing the Temporary Recommendations of the International Health Regulations (IHR) committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus by the Member States infected with WPV1, which include Afghanistan and Pakistan.Polio is a highly infectious disease and can cause permanent paralysis or death. The poliovirus can spread easily and over large distances.It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travellers and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response.Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas should be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.The twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under IHR regarding the international spread of poliovirus, held in February 2019 concluded that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, States infected with wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) with potential risk of international spread, and states infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with potential risk of international spread should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Wild poliovirus type 1"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Iran (Islamic Republic of)", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/23-may-2019-ebola-drc-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-23", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "23 May 2019Although this past week continues to bear witness to a steady rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall security situation has allowed for the resumption of most response activities. While no major insecurity incidents have occurred, outbreak response teams, local healthcare workers, and community members cooperating with response efforts, are increasingly subjected to threats made against them by armed groups present in hotspot areas such as Katwa and Butembo. These threats are often disseminated through leaflets or direct intimidation. Armed groups\u2019 presence, activities and increasing direct threats against response teams continue to be reported in other EVD affected areas, in particular Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, resulting in some healthcare workers being unwilling to don personal protective equipment or perform critical Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures out of fear of violence being levied against them or the healthcare facilities where they operate.During the past three weeks, reports indicate that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 349 cases reported in the last 21 days between 1 - 21 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 15 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2).As of 21 May, a total of 1866 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1241 died (case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (1051) were female and 30% (545) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases). 490 EVD patients who received care at ETCs have been successfully discharged.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Other health zones include: Alimbongo, Biena, Bunia, Kalunguta, Kayna, Komanda, Kyondo, Lubero, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Mutwanga, Nyankunde, Oicha, Rwampara and Tchomia.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

From 1 January through 30 April 2019, over 7700 confirmed cases have been reported. Also, as of 30 April 2019, 50 000 probable cases have been reported on the island since 2018, with 22 000 probable cases reported in 2019. Overall, fourteen deaths related (seven directly related) to dengue infections have been reported since 2018. Dengue-related emergency room visits have increased from 475 visits in 2018 to 1102 visits in 2019. Likewise, the number of hospitalizations has increased from twelve in 2017 to 156 in 2018 and 271 in 2019 as of 30 April 2019. According to local authorities, hospital capacities are still sufficient to handle cases.The southern parts of the island are the most affected areas with cases dispersed across settlements with known prior transmission in Etang-Sal\u00e9, Les Avirons, Saint-Joseph and Petite-Ile Saint-Louis. The number of cases in the western and northern parts of the island are also increasing and new areas of transmission have been detected weekly in all parts of the island since March 2019.Between 2014 and 2016, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. Since 2017, the most commonly reported serotype was DENV-2, with DENV-1 and DENV-4 being occasionally reported among imported cases. However, as of 24 April 2019, fourteen locally acquired cases of DENV-1 have been reported.The competent vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are both found on La R\u00e9union island. However, Ae. albopictus had the highest relative abundance and Ae. aegypti larvae are only found on the west coast of the island.Notification of dengue fever has been mandatory on La R\u00e9union island since 2006. On 10 July 2018, local authorities raised the level of emergency risk of the civil security plan to level 4, corresponding to a medium-level epidemic. This risk level is still valid to date. The local health authority (Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9 - Oc\u00e9an Indien) and the regional office of Sant\u00e9 publique France in La R\u00e9union are currently following the situation and a number of actions have been implemented on La R\u00e9union island by local authorities:The first documented dengue outbreak occurred in 1977\u20131978 and affected approximately 30% of the population of La Reunion. Subsequently, locally acquired sporadic cases and clusters of dengue fever have been reported. However, the upsurge of confirmed and probable cases reported in 2018 is unprecedented. This could be partly explained by:La R\u00e9union is a popular touristic destination and the current outbreak increases the likelihood of exporting dengue virus to other countries. In addition, the high number of travelers from other dengue endemic countries also pose the risk of introducing other serotypes of dengue to La R\u00e9union.For more information on Dengue fever in la R\u00e9union:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "France", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/17-may-2019-mers-saudi-arabia-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-17", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "17 May 2019From 9 through 30 April 2019, the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported nine additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including three deaths. Of the nine cases reported, five were associated with ongoing clusters in three cities. Three cases (including one death) were reported in Alkhafji city in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, one case in Alderb city in Jazan region and one case in Alkharji city in Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia.Details of the ongoing clusters are available in the Disease Outbreak News published on 9 May 2019.The link below provides details of the nine reported cases:From 2012 through 30 April 2019, a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 839 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the IHR. The associated deaths reported to WHO were identified through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans, especially from close unprotected contact with infected patients. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment of MERS. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (e.g. in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS cases have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS patient to another individual have been documented.MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking camel\u2019s raw milk or camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/16-may-2019-monkeypox-singapore-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-16", "headline": "Monkeypox - Singapore", "main_text": "16 May 2019On 9 May 2019, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox. The case-patient is a 38 year old Nigerian man who arrived in Singapore on 28 April 2019 and attended a workshop from 29-30 April. Prior to his travel to Singapore, he had worked in the Delta state in Nigeria, and had attended a wedding on 21 April 2019 in a village in Ebonyi State, Nigeria.The patient developed fever, muscle aches, chills and skin rash on 30 April. He reported that he had remained in his hotel room most of the time between 1 and 7 May. He was transferred to a public hospital by ambulance on 7 May and referred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on the same day, where he was isolated for further management. Skin lesion samples were taken on 8 May and tested positive for monkeypox virus by the National Public Health Laboratory on the same day. He is currently in a stable condition.Based on investigations thus far, authorities in Singapore have traced and contacted a total of 23 close contacts, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop, one staff at the workshop venue, and four hotel staff who had close contact with the affected individual. Healthcare workers who were in contact with the patient had used personal protection equipment. MOH\u2019s investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.One of the 18 workshop participants had left Singapore before the patient was diagnosed. This contact is a Nigerian national who travelled by air to Nigeria on 5 May. The Nigerian national IHR focal point has been provided with details of the contact for follow up action, as necessary. Potential sources of exposure and possible epidemiological links within Nigeria are currently being investigated.Close contacts of the affected individual were referred to NCID for further assessment and offered post-exposure prophylaxis with smallpox vaccination, which can prevent disease or reduce the severity of symptoms. As of 15 May 2019, 14 persons were vaccinated. As a precautionary measure, close contacts have been quarantined either at home or designated government quarantine facility and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the confirmed case. If anyone develops symptoms, they will be treated at NCID. All other contacts, who have a low risk of being infected, have been placed under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status.Singapore MOH released a press statement on 9 May 2019, providing information about the situation, advice for the public, and measures being taken to minimize the risk of any potential onward transmission of the disease.Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) and belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family. The disease is self-limiting, with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14-21 days. There is currently no vaccine specifically for monkeypox. The animal reservoir remains unknown, although it is likely to include rodents. Direct contact with affected live or dead animals through hunting and consumption of bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection.This is the first diagnosed case of monkeypox infection in Singapore. The patient was a traveller arriving from Nigeria, where a multistate monkeypox outbreak has been ongoing since September 2017.Given that authorities in Singapore have promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the primary case, contact tracing and quarantine, surveillance and risk communication, the risk of onward spread in the country is low.Residents and travelers to endemic areas/countries should avoid contact with sick, dead or live animals that could harbor MPXV (rodents, marsupials, and primates) and should refrain from eating or handling bush meat. Hand hygiene using soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizer should be emphasized. Any illness during travel or upon return should be reported to a health professional, including information about all recent travel and immunization history. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the MPXV infection.Timely contact tracing, surveillance measures and raising awareness of imported emerging diseases among health care providers are essential to prevent secondary cases and effectively manage monkeypox cases and outbreaks.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed MPXV infection should implement standard, contact and droplet infection control precautions. Samples taken from people and animals with suspected MPXV infection should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel to, or trade with, Singapore or Nigeria based on available information at this time.For more information on Monkeypox:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Monkeypox"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Singapore", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/16-may-2019-ebola-drc-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-16", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "16 May 2019Although the security situation has subsided mildly into an unpredictable calm, the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continues to intensify in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with more than 100 confirmed cases reported this week.The main drivers behind the continued rise in cases stems from insecurity hampering access to critical hotspot areas, persistent pockets of poor community acceptance and hesitation to participate in response activities, and delayed detection and late presentation of EVD cases to Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs)/Transit Centres (TCs).Of particular concern are the community deaths resulting from the culmination of these factors. Community deaths denote all EVD (confirmed and probable) cases who died outside of an ETC/TC. This includes cases who die at home, as well as those who die within public/private hospitals and other health centres. On average, community deaths comprise approximately 40% of cases reported each week. This proportion fluctuates on a weekly basis, ranging from 28% to 43% of cases since the beginning of April after peaking as high as 71% in February. Of the total deaths (1147) currently listed in surveillance systems, approximately two thirds (68%) occurred outside of ETCs. Many of the patients who arrive at ETCs, often do so in a severe condition with a poor prognosis, and subsequently die shortly after admission. Community deaths also pose a major transmission risk as these cases have spent more time in the community while symptomatic and remain highly infectious at the time of their death and thereafter; propagating EVD to other members of the community such as family members and healthcare workers.Despite the continued increase in EVD cases, it should be noted that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta, and Beni. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 350 cases reported in the last 21 days between 24 April \u2013 14 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). A new case was also reported in the health zone of Alimbongo this week with links to cases deriving from Katwa. Current transmission patterns also illustrate the challenges resulting from cases originating from hotpot health zones and re-introducing the virus to areas where transmissions have previously been successfully halted. During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 18 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2).As of 14 May, a total of 1739 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1147 died (case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (974) were female and 30% (514) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 102 (6% of total cases). Of the EVD patients who received care at ETCs, 459 have been successfully discharged.Risk communication and community engagement teams continue to spread messages about the importance of seeking care early at healthcare facilities for an increased chance of survival. These messages have been particularly effective in Beni, where affected individuals have been reporting to the ETCs more frequently and more rapidly after onset of symptoms. The risk communication and community engagement actors have been instrumental in mediating instances of reluctance and resistance at the community level to ensure peaceful agreements are reached and that other pillars of the response such as vaccination, infection prevention and control (IPC), and safe and dignified burials (SDB) are able to carry out their respective response activities.It is anticipated that the rising case figures will continue within the hotspot areas in the coming weeks given the resumption of most major response activities, which will lead to the detection of more cases. The increased transmission rates witnessed recently continue to demonstrate a heightened risk of EVD spreading to other neighbouring provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to surrounding countries.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Other health zones include: Alimbongo, Biena, Bunia, Kalunguta, Kayna, Komanda, Kyondo, Lubero, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Mutwanga, Nyankunde, Oicha, Rwampara, and Tchomia.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. Renewed efforts and honing of security mitigation measures, addressing procedural, operational and physical security means to ensure staff safety and security are undertaken. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A total of 3 141 suspected cases, of which 909 (28.9%) were laboratory confirmed and 1 236 (39.4 %) epidemiologically linked cases including 30 deaths (case fatality ratio=1.0 %), have been reported in all of the 24 governorates (range 1 \u2013 1 274). The majority of cases were reported from Kasserine (1 274 cases) and Sfax (212 cases) governorates. In April 2019, four additional governorates were particularly affected with 155, 116, 93 and 69 cases reported from Kairouan, Tunis, Sousse and Nabeul respectively.The two most affected age groups were those older than 15 years (31%) and infants between the age of 6 and 12 months (28%). The male: female ratio was 1.2. Eighty four percent of affected children between 1 and 5 years were not vaccinated. Death was reported in 30 cases ranging in age from 15 days to 41 years of age (median, 7.5 months).To date, the number of reported measles cases is above the average annual number (12 cases) registered in the past 10 years in the country, with the highest number (48 cases) reported in 2012.In 2013, Tunisia changed its immunization strategy and introduced the first dose of measles-containing-vaccine at the age of 12 months instead of 9 months (Fig. 1).The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Tunisia is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public health response measures include:A total of seven Tunisian governorates have a border with Algeria. Despite the absence of official number for people crossing the border, it is known that many families move freely between the two countries, which induces a moderate risk at regional level, whereas the risk at global level remains low.Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10\u201312 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2\u20133 weeks.While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, the provision of vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles, as it is associated with reduced mortality and severity of complications. In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of measles cases result in death and in most vulnerable groups deaths can reach up to 30%. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population\u2019s immunity status.Immunization is the only effective preventive measure against measles. Two doses of measles-rubella (MR) are recommended to ensure immunity.WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to, and trade with Tunisia based on the available information from the current outbreak.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Tunisia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON152", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-09", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "From 1 March through 8 April 2019, the National International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 45 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 13 deaths.

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (e.g. in a health care setting).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS cases have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS patient to another individual have been documented.MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking camel\u2019s raw milk or camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON169", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-09", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak response this past week continues to be hampered by insecurity. On 3 May in Katwa, a Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) team was violently attacked following the completion of a burial for a deceased EVD case. In Butembo and surrounding health zones, response activities were repeatedly halted due to a number of serious security incidents taking place from 4-6 May. On 8 May, a group of over 50 armed militia infiltrated the city centre. Security forces repelled the attack following intense gunfire in close proximity to staff accommodations. Although activities resumed on 9 May, after almost five consecutive days of suspension, threats of further attacks against EVD response teams and facilities remain prevalent.These security incidents, and especially the resultant lack of access to EVD affected communities, remain a major impediment to the response, with teams unable to perform robust surveillance nor deliver much needed treatment and immunisations. The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers. Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this EVD outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.EVD transmission remains most intense in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni and Kalunguta hotspot health zones, which collectively account for the vast majority (93%) of the 303 cases reported in the last 21 days between 17 April \u2013 7 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 78 health areas within 15 of the 21 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). It is expected that the resumption of response activities will bring a substantial increase in the number of cases reported in the coming weeks due to the backlog from the disruptions.As of 7 May, a total of 1600 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1069 died (case fatality of 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 57% (907) were female and 30% (475) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 97 (6% of total cases). 442 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been successfully discharged.On 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new vaccination recommendations in light of the increasing number of EVD cases and continued insecurity in this outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (click here for the full recommendations). The panel made recommendations pertaining to adjusting vaccine dosages, expanding vaccine eligibility, ring vaccination operational improvements, and strengthening training of local healthcare workers to aid in the EVD response.The rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine dosage and eligibility criteria have been revised. For high-risk individuals such as contacts and contacts of contacts, the new SAGE recommendations advise the use of 0.5mL of vaccine instead of 1mL. This revised dose has been previously used during the 2015 Ebola \u00e7a Suffit! trial in Guinea, and is expected to provide similar efficacy in this current EVD outbreak. Those at lower risks are now to receive 0.2mL instead. SAGE also recommends expanding the accessibility of the vaccine to more individuals in affected health areas. In addition to high-risk individuals, it is now recommended that individuals who are potential contacts due to their residence in the villages or neighbourhoods with incident cases (i.e. where EVD cases have been reported in the last 21 days) be offered the rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine. SAGE believes that by expanding vaccine eligibility, this would address some of the requests from communities in affected health areas for the vaccine to be more widely available, foster greater trust, and improve willingness of communities to engage with other EVD response activities.SAGE advised the implementation of an adaptive operational approach to ring vaccinations, implemented in two main methods: pop-up vaccinations and targeted geographic vaccinations. Pop-up vaccination would be conducted by inviting contacts and contacts of contacts to a previously agreed upon temporary location some distance away from the residence of contacts. In areas where accurate identification of contacts and contacts of contacts is not possible due to insecurity, targeted geographic vaccination of whole villages or quartiers would be administered at a fixed location with security present. Both of these vaccination operational methods have been utilised successfully before, and are expected to make the vaccination process more efficient and secure for both healthcare providers and the patients they are caring for.SAGE additionally recommends offering an alternative vaccine (other than rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) to those at lower risk within affected health areas or neighbouring areas. WHO has reviewed evidence provided by two vaccine manufacturers, and the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) investigational Ebola vaccine is being considered and evaluated by a coalition led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. At this time, this vaccine is in the late stages of formal trials and is expected to be deployed to the field in the near future. These efforts are in line with previous SAGE recommendations regarding the need for more studies to assess the efficacy of additional, alternative Ebola vaccines.SAGE also supported the proposal to introduce alternative individual informed consent forms and follow up procedures which can potentially simplify and expedite both the vaccination and safety follow up processes. Aside from pregnant women who will be actively followed up until delivery or end of pregnancy, and infants 6-12 months of age who will receive a single visit at day 21, all other case follow up will be completed through passive reporting of adverse events via telephone.In addition to technical recommendations, WHO and partners are working closely with residents of Ebola-affected communities to empower them to take on greater ownership of the EVD response. Through intensifying training and engagement with local community members, WHO aims to have the majority of vaccination teams comprised of local healthcare providers by the end of the month. Other key elements to transferring ownership of the response to the communities includes fulfilling community requests made in relation to development projects, and ensuring all persons residing in at-risk areas are well-informed about the status of the outbreak, transmission prevention, and availability of care through further mass communication initiatives.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Other health zones include: Biena, Bunia, Kalunguta, Kayna, Komanda, Kyondo, Lubero, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyankunde, Oicha, Rwampara and Tchomia.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, please see:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/07-may-2019-measles-western-pacific-region-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-07", "headline": "Measles - Western pacific Region (WPRO)", "main_text": "7 May 2019Globally, between 2016 and 2017, the number of reported measles cases increased by 31%, while in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPR), the total number of cases reported decreased by 82% during the same period. However, there was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163 cases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions. An unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR in 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has been eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries such as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently nine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles Elimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more than 36 months.To date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island Countries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made positive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination coverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and movement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable to outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations.The following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly available or information shared by Member States with WPRFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported nationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of cases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of cases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or outbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see hereIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the predominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number of cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the population size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons. In January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles cases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here and hereHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual reported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few years. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is 66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases, 27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew members of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link identified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8), Mainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan (6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam (1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second vaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the existing policy. For more information, please see hereAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China. Of these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but epidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases include 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see hereOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had achieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378 measles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases recorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were among persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13), Myanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New Zealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri Lanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a total of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of cases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with no or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see hereThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia increased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an increase of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to measles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among unimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases (76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for confirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000 population. For more information, please see here and hereFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three clusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39 cases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three in Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in Canterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines. A typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018 associated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related to travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person who made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have occurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018, a total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles elimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for first and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016. For more information, please see hereThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In February 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles outbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro Manila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five regions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1 January to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381 deaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared to the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded the highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%) followed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The majority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and under five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low immunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6 million Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from measles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine immunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root cause for this outbreak. For more information, please see hereFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported, including eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with recent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16), Philippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1), Madagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1). For more information, please see hereWHO is working with Member States and partners to:Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an increasing trend of measles cases reported across all regions, with outbreaks in countries that had previously achieved elimination status. Furthermore, the resurgence of endemic measles has occurred despite high national immunization coverage in some countries. This reflects the risk that measles virus can spread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and local levels, or gaps in population immunity among sub-populations. Infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants and those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be protected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates (> 95%) are high. Infants, populations with poor access to health care services, and comorbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A deficiency are vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease after infection.Given the variable immunization coverage and capacity for detection and response, the risk of continued transmission remains, and there is ongoing possibility of further spread internationally. Countries experiencing regular movement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to or from measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles; countries with low level of immunization coverage (< 95%) at the district and local level are also vulnerable to outbreaks.The recent outbreaks have been fuelled by: 1) low immunization coverage due to gaps in routine immunization programs; 2) low immunization coverage among subpopulations; 3) movement of people domestically and internationally, and; 4) vaccine hesitancy.Measles has a long incubation period with the average time from exposure to onset of early symptoms of about 10 - 12 days, and from exposure to rash onset an average of 14 days (range 7- 21 days), which means that international travel can be completed before an infected traveller becomes symptomatic. Case patients may be infectious from approximately 3 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts.With ongoing measles outbreaks in all regions, the WHO Regional Office for the WPR urges Member States to refer to and implement the following published WHO guidance, which provides specific recommendations to strengthen preparedness and response to measles outbreaks, including detailed procedures for effective surveillance and investigation of acute rash and fever cases, which enable rapid detection and containment of imported cases of measles:WPRO Measles Elimination Field Guide (2013)1 [pp. 25\u201433, 38\u201452]; and Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (2018)2 [pp. 72\u201476]. In particular, all countries in the WPR - regardless of country context or whether they have achieved elimination of endemic measles transmission or are currently experiencing an ongoing outbreak - should urgently take the following actions:WHO has not made a recommendation towards compulsory vaccination, travel restrictions, or border screening for measles. It is up to countries to decide how best to ensure their population is immunized to protect individuals and communities from disease. Signage about measles at air and sea ports, including on how to seek health care if measles is suspected, is a useful adjunct to raising measles awareness in the community. People planning international travel should ensure they have been vaccinated against measles because of the high risk of exposure to the measles virus from fellow travellers and in many countries in the world where measles is currently spreading.The current global resurgence of measles is an urgent signal for countries to renew focus on implementing the strategies, activities, and procedures detailed in the \u201cMeasles Elimination Field Guide\u201d1 and the \u201cRegional Strategy and Plan of Action\u201d2 to achieve sufficient population immunity to reduce the risk of outbreaks and prevent sustained endemic measles transmission.1Measles Elimination Field Guide (WPR, 2013)2Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific (WPR, 2018)3The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (EURO, 2013)", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Western pacific Region (WPRO)", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON140", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-06", "headline": "Measles - Ukraine", "main_text": "In the first two months of 2019, 34 300 measles cases have been reported in 42 countries of the WHO European Region, including 13 measles-related deaths in three countries (Albania, Romania and Ukraine). The majority of cases are reported in Ukraine, with more than 25 000 cases (>70%)1.As of 28 March 2019, the WHO European Region reported a total of 83 540 measles cases and 74 related deaths for 2018. This is compared to 25 869 cases and 42 deaths in 2017, and 5 273 cases and 13 deaths in 2016. In 2018, eight countries reported over 2 000 cases each including Ukraine (n= 53 218), Serbia (n=5 076), Israel (3 140), France (n=2 913), Italy, (n=2 686), Russian Federation (n=2 256), Georgia (n=2 203) and Greece (n=2 193).Although the European Region achieved its highest ever estimated coverage for the second dose of measles vaccination in 2017 (90%), countries with measles outbreaks have experienced a range of challenges in recent years including a decline or stagnation in overall routine immunization coverage in some cases, low coverage at subnational level or among some marginalized groups and immunity gaps in older populations. Most cases are occurring in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals.According to the most recent report from the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC), based on 2017 data, measles elimination has been verified in 37 (out of the 53) countries in the WHO European Region, which documented interrupted transmission for at least 36 months. Five countries provided evidence for the interruption of measles transmission for a period of at least 24 months but less than 36 months, and one for interruption for transmission for 12 months. Ten countries including Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine remain endemic for measles. The RVC will meet in June 2019 to review reports from National Verification Committees (NVCs) for measles and rubella elimination documenting each country\u2019s status by the end of 2018. All countries reporting measles cases continuously for 12 months or more will have to provide a detailed epidemiological and molecular epidemiology (measles virus genotypes and lineages) analysis to document absence of continuous measles transmission or re-established endemic transmission.1Numbers for 2016-2019 are based on monthly surveillance data received by WHO as of 28 March 2019. These data are reported in the WHO EpiData series and subject to change as new updates from countries are received.The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015\u20132020 (EVAP) states that at least 95% of individuals in every population needs to be immune, through two doses of vaccination or prior exposure to the virus, to ensure community protection for everyone \u2013 including babies too young to be vaccinated and others who cannot be immunized due to existing diseases and medical conditions. The EVAP was adopted unanimously by all 53 Member States in the European Region at the 64th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe on 18 September 2014.The WHO Regional Office for Europe continues to work with countries in the Region to enhance their immunization and disease surveillance systems. This includes building capacities and providing guidance to:Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Transmission from person-to-person is airborne, as well as by direct or indirect contact of secretions (nasal, throat) of an infected person. The virus can cause widespread outbreaks in the presence of large numbers of susceptible persons.Even with implementation of outbreak response measures, measles continues to circulate in the European Region as a result of suboptimal vaccination coverage and population immunity gaps. If outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread to additional countries within and beyond the Region. It is proportional to the size of the population that remains susceptible to measles. Measles has also been reported among health workers and nosocomial transmission has contributed to some outbreaks.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, routine immunization coverage is continuously high (\u2265 95%) and immunity gaps in the population closed. As long as measles continues to circulate anywhere in the world, no country can avoid importation, but they can protect their populations through high routine and supplemental immunization coverage of susceptible individuals.Initial symptoms of measles, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, red eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. A few days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is usually infectious 4 days before the start of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash.There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles. Vaccination is the only way to prevent the disease. High vaccination coverage of at least 95% with two doses of measles vaccines in all population groups and age cohorts at national level and in all districts is crucial to elimination.Countries need to identify susceptible individuals and population groups and consider undertaking catch-up immunization or supplementary immunization activities to close immunity gaps. Tailored strategies to reach older populations and marginalized groups may be required.Every opportunity should be used to vaccinate susceptible children, adolescents and adults. Measles-containing vaccines should also be recommended for susceptible persons intending to travel to countries where measles is endemic and where outbreaks are ongoing.To protect health workers, prevent nosocomial infections and limit transmission of these diseases, health workers should be vaccinated. This includes those with an uncertain vaccination status and no or unknown history of disease.Elimination of measles is a priority goal that all European countries have firmly committed to. In adopting the EVAP 2015\u20132020, all 53 Member States of the Region committed to eliminating measles and rubella as one of the Region\u2019s priority immunization goals. The cornerstones for eliminating measles remain high population immunity to stop disease transmission and high-quality surveillance to monitor disease occurrence for public health action.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Ukraine", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/13-may-2019-rift-valley-fever-mayotte-france-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-03", "headline": "Rift Valley Fever - France", "main_text": "13 May 2019On 4 January 2019, the National IHR Focal Point for France informed WHO of five human autochthonous cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) diagnosed on Mayotte Island through the Early Warning and Response System of the European Union. The dates of symptom onset ranged from 22 November to 31 December 2018.From November 2018 to 03 May 2019, 129 confirmed human Rift Valley Fever (RVF) cases and 109 animal foci (23 small ruminants and 86 bovine) have been reported in Mayotte. After a steady decline in cases during the last three weeks of March 2019, a slight increase has been observed in April 2019. As of 3 May 2019, one new human case but no new animal foci have been reported. Both human RVF cases and animal foci are mainly located in the center and the north west of the main island Grande-Terre. However, since the end of March 2019, a few new animal foci have also been detected in the east of Grande-Terre and in Petite Terre of Mayotte.The following actions have been taken since the detection of the human cases in January 2019:RVF virus has been circulating actively on the island of Mayotte, in a context of regular import of the virus from nearby countries through illegal animal movements, the presence of susceptible animals and a favorable environment for mosquito vectors to maintain virus transmission locally. RVF virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes mainly belonging to the Aedes and Culex genera (but also Anopheles, Mansonia and other mosquito species) among animals. Mayotte, has a notable species richness of mosquitoes with 45 documented species belonging to 15 genera including Aedes and Culex which act as reservoirs of RVF virus. The risk of mosquito borne infections in animals should decrease in the coming months as the rainy season (December to April) in Mayotte is over. However, prolonged rain linked to post-cyclone Kenneth may lead to an increase in RVF cases.While the main route of infection of humans is through direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, tissues and organs of infected animals and aborted animal fetuses, it is highly contagious for humans when handling infected livestock. The high-risk groups including veterinarians, livestock farmers and butchers should conduct safe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices to prevent infections. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF virus has been reported.The RVF epizootic can cause agricultural impact and economic losses to communities due to high mortality and abortion rates among infected livestock, loss of public trust in safety of animal products (milk, meat) or bans of movement that might be put in place to control this outbreak. Local authorities have implemented appropriate control measures and strengthened the multisectoral One Health approach to prevent, detect and respond to the RVF outbreak. Nevertheless, there are concerns about a potential increase of cases and foci in May 2019, because of the Ramadan period where an increase of illegal cattle importations is expected. To date, there is no information suggesting the disease will spread beyond Mayotte.RVF is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects domestic animals (including cattle, sheep, camels and goats) and to a lesser extent human. The RVF virus is highly contagious for humans when handling potentially-infected livestock. Raising awareness of the risk factors of RVF transmission as well as protective measures such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites is the key to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to, and trade with Mayotte based on the current information available on this event.For more information on Rift Valley fever, please see the links below:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Rift Valley Fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "France", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON151", "date_of_publication": "2019-05-02", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The operating environment has become increasingly insecure and socio-politically complex. Insecurity remains a major impediment to ensuring timely response interventions in the affected communities. Ebola virus disease (EVD) response activities in Butembo and Katwa remained limited; however, these are gradually resuming following a comprehensive reinforcement of security measures and community engagement efforts. The overall security situation, nevertheless, remains volatile. While no significant injuries or damages are reported this week, access and activities in parts of Mandima, Masereka, Kalunguta and Vuhovi, remain irregular due to the presence of armed groups and other security concerns. New EVD cases are expected to continue to increase, in tandem with incidents of insecurity in these hotspot areas over the coming weeks, placing significant strain on response teams and the security resources available to secure their movements.Incidence of EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this week saw a considerable, although not unexpected, rise compared to the week prior. This observation is in line with previous instances where a disruption to response activities was followed by a spike in the number of new cases. Transmission remains most intense in the Katwa, Butembo, and Mandima hotspot areas (Figure 1 and Table 1). In addition, notable recurring re-introduction events having been documented in previously affected health zones such as Mabalako and Musienene, followed by local amplification and extension to affect new heath areas. In the 21 days between 10 \u2013 30 April 2019, 70 health areas within 15 health zones reported new cases; 45% of the 157 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 292 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Katwa (47%, n=137), Butembo (13%, n=38), Mandima (11%, n=32), Mabalako (7%, n=20), and Musienene (6%, n=17).As of 30 April, a total of 1495 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 984 died (case fatality rate 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (830) were female, and 28% (422) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 92 (6% of total cases). To date, a total of 415 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.From 27 to 30 April, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti, visited Butembo to review current response activities and bolster support for the response personnel currently operating there. During the visit, Dr Tedros and Dr Moeti travelled to Butembo to express their gratitude and show support to WHO and partner organisation staff, while also assessing the next steps needed to strengthen both security and the Ebola response effort. They also met with local political, business and religious leaders, and called on them to accelerate their efforts to help stabilise the surrounding environment. The visit concluded with both Dr Tedros and Dr Moeti reiterating their concerns for the present situation and repeating their appeal to the international community to intensify support to contain the outbreak by bridging the funding gap.Risk Communication & Community Engagement (RCCE) and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams have been collaborating in preparation for the launch of an IPC campaign due to commence on 5 May 2019, WHO World Hand Hygiene Day. The initial focus of this campaign is on Injection Safety, an initiative aimed at encouraging the greater use of oral medication over injectables and the safe use and handling of needles at healthcare facilities as a means of reducing EVD transmission risks. RCCE teams are also working closely with other WHO partners to bring about a new mass communication campaign in the coming weeks to promote key messages from all outbreak response pillars to the affected communities.As part of the continued efforts to empower communities to be more actively engaged in the EVD response, requests received from the numerous dialogues with local residents are being reviewed to aid the transfer of some of the response ownership back to the community. Recent dialogues have focused on addressing community-related incidents of reluctance or mistrust. Some notable successes from this effort have resulted, including some previously resistant contacts coming forward to re-engage with response activities, and pledging to assist by utilising their influence in the community to encourage greater cooperation with EVD response teams.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Other health zones include: Biena, Bunia, Kalunguta, Kayna, Komanda, Kyondo, Lubero, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyankunde, Oicha, Rwampara and Tchomia.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The first suspected case was a symptomatic 49-year-old woman who presented on 7 January 2019 to a health facility in Diosso town, 25 kilometres north of Pointe-Noire. Samples taken during a joint investigation of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO tested positive to chikungunya on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at INRB in Kinsasha.From 1 January to 14 April 2019, a total of 6,149 suspected cases of chikungunya have been reported in the country with approximately 54% of reported cases being female. One hundred and seventy-three blood samples have been collected with 61 (35.3%) testing positive by PCR at INRB. However, the scale of this outbreak has likely been underestimated given the limited detection capacity of the surveillance system in the country. Several mosquito breeding sites in affected areas and inadequate vector control mechanisms also represent major contributing factors for the outbreak.The Ministry of Health has reported that the outbreak has spread to eight of twelve health departments in the country (Kouilou, Bouenza, Pointe Noire, Plateaux, Pool, Niari, L\u00e9koumou and Brazzaville). Since the report of the first case on 7 January 2019, 47% of all cases have been reported from Kouilou Department. No deaths have been reported. This is the second outbreak reported in Congo since 2011 and no seasonal pattern has previously been observed.Based on available information, the risk of continued transmission and spread of chikungunya to unaffected areas cannot be ruled out. The overall risk is considered moderate at both the national and regional levels.Geographic spread of the vector and human cases is likely due to the high number of cases reported in several health departments, the presence of Aedes vectors in many parts of the country, ubiquity of breeding sites in and around living areas and poor coordination of response activities including vector control complicated by the ongoing rainy season. Strengthened disease surveillance will help inform the implementation of appropriate public health actions to control the outbreak.The WHO Regional Office is mobilizing financial and technical resources to support the ministry of health and WHO country office in controlling the ongoing outbreak and is prepared to support neighbouring countries if the outbreak spreads beyond Congo. The overall risk at global level is low.Reducing the number of natural and artificial breeding sites for mosquitoes has a significant impact on the prevention and control of chikungunya outbreaks. This requires affected communities to be mobilized to institute control measures including covering of water collection containers, proper waste disposal and improved environmental sanitation. During outbreaks, insecticides may be used to kill adult mosquitoes and immature larvae.Clothing which minimizes the exposure of skin during the day is advised during outbreaks as vectors are known to bite in daylight. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester).Basic precautions should be taken by people travelling to Congo including the use of mosquito repellents and wearing of long sleeved clothing. Also, the use of a mosquito bed net or window screens, air conditioning, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.For more information, please see the link below:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Chikungunya"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON149", "date_of_publication": "2019-04-25", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo - 2019-DON149", "main_text": "This past week witnessed a notable escalation of security incidents surrounding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) response efforts. On 19 April, an attack on a hospital in Katwa by armed militia resulted in the tragic death of Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a WHO epidemiologist, and the injury of two other healthcare workers. To ensure the safety of all outbreak responders, Ebola response activities have been temporarily halted in some high-risk health areas until security measures can be reinforced.WHO, the UN, and the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are actively collaborating to review current strategic and operational security measures to ensure the protection of healthcare workers in the field, and improve effective coordination and information sharing amongst all security elements covering the response. Existing operational security measures continue to be implemented and strengthened as well, including the establishment of security perimeters around the residences of EVD response personnel, increasing security at fixed locations, enhancing the joint quick response team (QRT) capacities of local police and UN security forces, and ensuring staff compliance with tracking procedures and adherence to curfew. These measures and other security risk management processes will be continually updated to reflect the needs of the evolving security situation on the ground.In addition to revising security measures, efforts in community outreach through direct dialogue with various community leaders are also being intensified. Since January, there has been a notable increase in community resistance incidents, primarily around Katwa and Butembo. Incidents in April are anticipated to reach or go beyond March levels. As gaining community understanding and acceptance is integral to our ability to mount an effective outbreak response, community engagement efforts remain a significant element of our response to alleviate future security risks to healthcare workers, develop and increase local community capacity to ensure continuity of response operations, and improve the overall security situation in EVD hotspot areas.Incidence of EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this week saw a lull compared to the week prior (Figure 1). However, this observation should be interpreted with caution and in the context of the recent disruption to response activities and case reporting in certain hotspot areas. In the 21 days between 3 \u2013 23 April 2019, 62 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 147 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 255 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (132), Butembo (29), Vuhovi (29), Mandima (21), Beni (15), Mabalako (9), Kalunguta (6), Musienene (6), Masereka (5), Oicha (2), and Kyondo (1).As of 23 April, a total of 1367 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 885 died (case fatality rate 65%). Of the total cases, 56% (765) were female, and 28% (386) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 90 (7% of total cases), including 33 deaths. To date, a total of 392 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.*Other health zones include the following: Biena, Bunia, Kalunguta, Kayna, Komanda, Kyondo, Lubero, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyankunde, Oicha, Rwampara, and Tchomia..**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community reluctance, refusal, and resistance due to mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries, including vaccination of HCW and FLWs at prioritised health facilities, have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread; this must continue to be scaled-up.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Of the 22 cases, 19 were reported from Wadi Aldwasir city including two healthcare workers. The remaining three cases, which are epidemiologically linked to the outbreak, were healthcare workers from a hospital in Khamees Mushait city, Asir region.Since the beginning of this outbreak in January 2019, a total of 61 MERS-CoV cases, with a case fatality ratio of 13.1% (8/61), have been reported in Wadi Aldwasir city. The median age of reported cases was 46 years (range 16 to 85 years). Of the 61 cases, 65% (n=46) were male, and 23% (n = 14) were health care workers. Investigations into the source of infection of the 61 cases found that 37 were health-care acquired infections, 14 were primary cases presumed to be infected from contact with dromedary camels and the remaining (10) infections occurred among close contacts outside of health care settings. As previously reported1, two human to human transmission amplification events took place at a hospital during this outbreak (one amplification event in the emergency department, and one amplification event in a cardiac intensive care unit; Figure 1).Figure 1. Transmission chain of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection associated with Wadi Aldwasir city, Riyadh region, outbreak, 2019 (n=61)The link below provides details of the 22 reported cases:From 2012 through 31 March 2019, a total of 2399 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 827 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR). The associated deaths reported to WHO were identified through follow-up with affected member states.As reported previously, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH) has conducted and completed a full-scale investigation of the MERS outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir including identification of all household and healthcare worker contacts of confirmed patients in all of the hospitals affected.As of 31 March 2019, a total of 380 contacts have been identified, including 260 household contacts and 120 healthcare worker contacts. All identified contacts were monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS. All secondary cases have been reported to WHO.Currently, all the listed contacts have been tested for MERS-CoV infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at least once and many contacts of known patients have been tested repeatedly. All secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to WHO. The last case from Wadi Aldwasir was reported on 12 March 2019.Within the affected health care facilities, infection prevention and control measures have been enhanced including intensive mandatory on-the-job training on infection control measures for all healthcare workers in emergency room and intensive care unit. Disinfection has been carried out in the emergency room and ICU of hospital A, which is fully operational and additional staff were mobilized to support infection control activities. Respiratory triage has been enforced in all healthcare facilities in the Riyadh region.The MoH media department launched an awareness campaign targeting Wadi Aldawasir city with special focus on camel owners and camel related activities.The Ministry of Agriculture is testing dromedaries in Wadi Aldwasir city and initial results have identified several PCR positive dromedaries in the city. Positive camels have been removed from the market and movement in and out of the camel market has been restricted. Camels owned by confirmed human cases were quarantined regardless of testing results. Full genome sequencing of available human and dromedary specimens have been conducted. Laboratory findings of camel testing by the Ministry of Agriculture have been reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or by transmission between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment of MERS. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, dromedary camel animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. Results of the completed epidemiological investigation, as well as full genome sequencing of available dromedary and human specimens are being used by Ministry of Health officials to further evaluate the zoonotic and human-to-human transmission that has occurred in Wadi Aldwasir outbreak.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS cases have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS patient to another individual have been documented.MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking camel\u2019s raw milk or camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.1\u00a0Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2013 26 February 2019", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/18-april-2019-yellow-fever-brazil-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-04-18", "headline": "Yellow fever - Brazil", "main_text": "18 April 2019In Brazil, seasonal increases of yellow fever have historically occurred between December and May. During the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons, the number of yellow fever cases was much larger than in previous years (Figures 1 & 2). The increase in cases was partly due to a geographical expansion of the areas affected by yellow fever to include areas previously considered risk-free (Figure 3).In the current 2018- 2019 season (July 2018 to March 2019), a total of 75 confirmed human cases, including 17 deaths (case fatality rate = 23%), have been reported in Brazil in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (62), Paran\u00e1 (12), and Santa Catarina (1). Of these cases, 88% (66/75) are males, the median age is 43 years, and 71% (53/75) are rural workers.In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the municipalities that reported confirmed cases are: Eldorado (16), Iporanga (15), Barra do Turbo (6), Cajati (5), Cananeia (4), Jacupiranga (4), Pariquera-a\u00e7u (4), Juquia (1), Registro (1), Serra Negra (1), Sete Barras (1), Ribeira (1), Vargem (1) and for 2 cases, the municipalities were unknown. In the state of Paran\u00e1, the municipalities with confirmed cases are: Guaraque\u00e7aba (2), Antonina (2), S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais (2), Morretes (1), Andrin\u00f3polis (3), Paranagu\u00e1 (1) and in 1 case, the municipality is unknown. The state of Santa Catarina reported one fatal confirmed human case of yellow fever. The case is a 36-year-old male, without vaccination, whose municipality is unknown.Likewise, in the same reporting period of July 2018 to March 2019, 33 confirmed epizootics were reported in five federal states: S\u00e3o Paulo (20), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2), and Paran\u00e1 (2). In the four weeks preceding this report, epizootics have been confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states.2018 As of Epidemiological week 26\nSource: Data published by the Brazil Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO*Epidemic curve showing two prior waves of transmission, one during the 2016-2017 seasonal period, with 778 human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017-2018 seasonal period, with 1,376 human cases, including 483 deaths.Source: Data published by the Brazil Ministry of Health and the S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 State Secretariats of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHOGiven the geographical expansion in Brazil of the human cases and the epizootic wave in the last two seasonal periods, the country has had to adjust its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3,526 municipalities in 2010 to 4,469 municipalities in 2018.In line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017. The use of fractional doses was also adopted to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities. This strategy was implemented in response to the 2018 yellow fever outbreak in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bah\u00eda (8 municipalities).Prior to the vaccination campaign, the states of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo had already vaccinated about 13.2 million people. During the campaign, an additional 13.3 million people were vaccinated in S\u00e3o Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro and 1.85 million in Bahia. This resulted in a vaccination coverage of 53.6%, 55.6%, and 55.0% respectively and across all 77 municipalities with the greatest risk of yellow fever1. Furthermore, data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health indicate that vaccination coverage of at least 95% was achieved in 17.8% (71/399) of the municipalities of Paran\u00e1, 23.7% (118/497) of the municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul and 14.9% (44/295) of the municipalities of Santa Catarina.Further transmission is expected in the coming months based on seasonal patterns. Recent human cases of yellow fever during the current seasonal cycle have been reported in S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, and Santa Catarina states in Southeast Brazil.The preliminary assessment of the vaccination coverage in municipalities from Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Santa Catarina states suggests a high proportion of persons remaining susceptible and the necessity to intensify communication to encourage greater vaccine uptake among groups at risk.The geographical distribution of human cases and epizootics from the current and previous two seasonal cycles (Figure 3) suggests southward movement of the virus, which presents further risk to the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. Furthermore, these areas have ecosystems favourable for yellow fever transmission and borders with other countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.During the 2017-2018 yellow fever season, human cases of yellow fever acquired in Brazil were reported among travelers, most of whom arrived from countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter).To date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented. An investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute and reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of the yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of 2 municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu\u00eata and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted in some of the affected states during the 2016-2017 outbreak, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever, indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Currently, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as High at the national level, Moderate at the regional level, and Low at the global level.On 25 January 2019, PAHO/WHO alerted2 Member States about the beginning of the seasonal period for yellow fever and therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, PAHO/WHO advises Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue efforts to immunize susceptible populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.WHO recommends vaccination of international travelers above 9 months of age going to Brazil. The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travelers were updated by WHO on 3 May 20183; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website:Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization, if vaccine is administered at least 10 days before travel. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer life-long protection against yellow fever infection: a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed and should not be required of international travelers as a condition of entry. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable.WHO advises against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Brazil based on the information available for this event.Information on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and other countries in the Americas is published regularly on the PAHO/WHO website and on the Brazil Ministry of Health website:Information on the yellow fever situation in S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, and Santa Catarina states are available at:For more information on yellow fever, please see:1This data is preliminary and subject to change.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Brazil", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON147", "date_of_publication": "2019-04-18", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to increase this week; however, it remained confined to a limited geographical area within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This recent trend is likely attributable, in part, to past and ongoing security issues, unrest amongst certain local populations, and lingering community mistrust towards outbreak response teams. Improved case detection and response activities have been observed in previously inaccessible hotspots.In the 21 days between 27 March and 16 April 2019, 55 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 39% of the 143 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 249 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (124), Vuhovi (40), Mandima (28), Butembo (24), Beni (16), Oicha (6), Mabalako (5), Kalunguta (2), Masereka (2), Musienene (1), and Lubero (1).As of 16 April, a total of 1290 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 833 died (case fatality rate 65%). Of the 1290 cases with reported age and sex, 56% (725) were female, and 28% (361) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89 (7% of total cases), including 32 deaths. To date, a total of 379 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.On 12 April 2019, the International Health Regulation (IHR) Emergency Committee convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss whether the EVD outbreak posed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and offer response recommendations. While the Emergency Committee and the WHO Director-General reiterated their serious concern at the recent rise in the number of cases and the high risk of regional spread, upon consultation with various technical experts and further review of available epidemiological data, it was concluded that the current outbreak did not constitute a PHEIC. For the complete WHO statement concerning the 12 April IHR Emergency Committee meeting, please see here.The ongoing vaccination efforts have produced some promising results this past week. On 12 April 2019, WHO and Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale (INRB) published a preliminary analysis concerning the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine currently utilised in this outbreak (please see full report here). The data suggested the vaccine demonstrated notable efficacy in preventing Ebola infections in vaccinated individuals compared to those who are unvaccinated. Between 2-4 April 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) convened a meeting to review the epidemiological data and offer further recommendations to the ongoing vaccination efforts. They urged the further expansion of those eligible for vaccination to include children older than 6 months and lactating women; two populations observed to have especially high attack rates and high case fatality rates (please see here for further highlights from the SAGE meeting).In light of the findings, WHO and partners are evolving the existing vaccination strategy on the ground. Along with intensifying contact tracing of cases and vaccinating their known immediate contacts, a greater emphasis is being placed on following up contacts of contacts and ensuring these at-risk individuals are adequately vaccinated against Ebola. Various approaches are being employed at this time to vaccinate people at-risk including:Through these strategies, 23 operational vaccination teams have effectively closed previously observed gaps in the vaccination rings surrounding reported cases; rings are currently pending for 10 of the 257 cases confirmed during the period between 28 March to 16 April 2019. As of 16 April, a total of 102 501 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of whom 29 720 were HCWs/FLWs. Outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, vaccination of frontline healthcare workers commenced in neighbouring Rwanda on 16 April 2019, with 176 HCWs/FLWs already vaccinated. It is expected that the vaccination strategy will be an effective means to slowing the spread of EVD.Infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts have also yielded some notable progress this past week. A revised IPC strategy with an operational work plan for February to May 2019 period has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The strategy and work plan are intended to guide the national coordination activities of the Ebola response\u2019s IPC Task Force, and the implementation of activities by the IPC commissions and partners at the subnational level. To support this operational shift, Risk Communication and Community Engagement research initiatives are being developed to better understand transmission pathways that can be addressed by the IPC coordination activities. Additional support will be provided by collecting feedback through community dialogue on how IPC can be better implemented at the community level.While the EVD outbreak remains ongoing and the rise in number of cases is likely to continue in the following weeks, it should be noted that substantial progress has been made to adapt response strategies to the ever-evolving situation. Despite the multitude of challenges posed by having to mount a robust outbreak response in the demanding circumstances in which this EVD outbreak is currently taking place, WHO and partners are continuing to intensify all facets of the response efforts to curtail the further spread of EVD in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of HealthFor further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

During the last 21 days (20 March to 9 April 2019), 57 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 207 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni (21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1).As of 9 April, a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87 (7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency Committee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to provide recommendations.Progress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas. IPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to decontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging in regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying decontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid evaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients\u2019 homes and identifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results from these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the type of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary supervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard precautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies (e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and lack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship at priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas.WHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing with activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between communities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees are ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key part of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities. Information about community disquiet are systematically collected and monitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal, or resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as quickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the community members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research activities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring areas.In an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the outbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in various affected areas have been organized. Students and community associations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand how EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of misinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts.The security situation has remained calm for the past week as well. Provisional results released on 9 April by the Commission \u00c9lectorale Nationale Ind\u00e9pendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in Beni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused no significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities.The continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners remain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable populations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response efforts.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information.

During the last 21 days (13 March to 2 April 2019), 57 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 135 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 172 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (50), Vuhovi (34), Mandima (28), Masereka (18), Beni (13), Butembo (12), Oicha (8), Kayna (3), Lubero (3), Kalunguta (1), Bunia (1) and Musienene (1). WHO and partners will continue to adapt our strategies and strengthen response efforts to limit the further spread of EVD in these health areas.As of 2 April, a total of 1100 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 690 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1100 cases with reported age and sex, 58% (633) were female, and 29% (320) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 81 (7% of total cases), including 27 deaths.To date, a total of 338 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged. As part of a broader programme to provide care for Ebola survivors and build sustainable, local response capacity, an eye care training programme and clinic was completed this week in Beni through the combined efforts of WHO, Ministry of Health, and a team of ophthalmologists from Emory University and the University of North Carolina. A total of 252 EVD survivors were screened in the eye clinic and ten national ophthalmologists were trained to provide higher level eye care in their communities. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive. Of note were some of the clinical findings witnessed in the present cohort of EVD survivors. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates when compared to cases from the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak.A Risk Communication and Community Engagement partners meeting was held in Goma from 25-26 March, involving more than 80 participants representing the different partners participating in the outbreak response. The discussion focused on engagement strategies that have worked in the past, what is working on the ground currently, and what needs to be improved to build upon our current gains and address future challenges.The recent shift of emphasis in the response strategy to promoting greater engagement and ownership by affected communities is beginning to produce results. While community reluctance and mistrust remain present in certain areas around Butembo and Katwa, other areas saw a notable decrease in resistance to the presence of response workers. Diligent efforts at engaging with community committees through direct dialogue resulted in the reopening of the ETC in Katwa, bringing the total number of operational facilities providing care up to six ETCs in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Komanda, Mangina, and six transit centres in Beni, Bunia, Katwa, Kayna, Bwanasura, and Oicha. A more proactive approach to investigating and resolving incidents in the communities is also being undertaken to minimise the risk of misunderstandings and to mitigate potential sources of mistrust between local residents and healthcare providers.The increase in the number of cases this week highlights the difficult environment the outbreak is occurring in, as well as the multitude of evolving challenges confronting the outbreak response on a daily basis. A holistic approach involving rigorous implementation of proven measures to break chains of transmission, thorough contract tracing, continued vaccination of high-risk contacts, and persistent efforts in community engagement must be persevered with to curtail the spread of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances.

Of the 68 MERS cases reported in February, 19 cases occurred in cities other than Wadi Aldwasir.This Disease Outbreak News update describes the 19 cases. Among these cases, fifteen were sporadic, and four were reported as part of two unrelated clusters. Cluster 1 involved two cases in Buridah city; and Cluster 2 involved two cases in Riyadh city. The link below provides details of the 19 reported cases.A separate Disease Outbreak News will provide an update on the outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir which affected 49 cases and resulted in seven deaths in February making a total of 52 cases since the onset of the outbreak.From 2012 through 28 February 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS cases reported globally to WHO is 2374 with 823 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans, especially from close unprotected contact with infected patients. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment of MERS. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (e.g. in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS cases have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS patient to another individual have been documented.MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking camel\u2019s raw milk or camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON141", "date_of_publication": "2019-03-28", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a rise in the number of new cases this past week. At this time, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities. Despite this, progress is being made in areas such as Mandima, Masereka and Vuhovi, where response teams are gradually able to access once again and acceptance by the community of proven interventions to break the chains of transmission is observed.During the last 21 days (6 \u2013 26 March), a total of 125 new cases were reported from 51 health areas within 12 of the 21 health zones affected to date; 38% of the 133 health areas affected to date (Figure 2). The majority of these cases were from remaining hotspot areas of Katwa (36), Butembo (14), and three emerging clusters in Mandima (19), Masereka (18) and Vuhovi (17), in addition to a limited number of cases in other areas (Table 1). All cases link back to chains of transmission in hotspot areas, with onward local transmission observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases have visited prior to their detection and isolation.As of 26 March, a total of 1029 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 642 died (case fatality ratio 62%). Of 1029 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (584) were female, and 30% (307) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 78 (8% of total cases), including 27 deaths.Community engagement efforts to encourage greater local participation and ownership of the outbreak response is ongoing and has yielded some success in many areas. In Butembo and Katwa this past week, a total of 4171 households have been visited by community health volunteers and Red Cross volunteers. This past week also saw the establishment of nine community committees to enhance direct dialogue with healthcare workers and empower community members to partake in the decision-making process of the local response. Special dialogues are being held in the communities where there have been the most frequent incidents. Herein, an anthropologist first meets with the community to ascertain their concerns, then arranges for communal meetings where these concerns can be discussed, including amongst local youth leaders, women\u2019s associations, traditional practitioners, and healthcare providers.As of 26 March, 324 EVD patients have recovered and been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres. In Beni, local NGOs and international teams are currently conducting eye care training for ten ophthalmologists and establishing dedicated eye care clinics to provide screening and eye care for EVD survivors. To date, 145 survivors have been screened in these clinics and a total of 293 survivors have enrolled in the survivor\u2019s programme.Notable strides have also been made in improving IPC capacities in healthcare facilities. Since January, IPC field teams have decontaminated over 250 healthcare facilities and households, provided over 100 supply kits, and trained over 3000 healthcare workers in IPC. A recent National IPC workshop has been completed to aid the implementation of new IPC strategies, while the establishment of an IPC task force has further improved partner communication and coordination at all levels. The work is, however, is ongoing and IPC teams continue to respond to new instances of nosocomial transmission with the emergence of clusters in previously unaffected communities and health facilities.These local successes do not come without its challenges. When visiting communities in high risk areas, Ebola response teams sometimes face security challenges. Though no major security incidents have been reported over the last 10 days, the overall situation remains fragile. WHO and partners have recently established operational analysis and coordination centres to both gain a more holistic understanding of how we can engage communities more effectively, as well as further increase operational awareness of the day to day operations to ensure the safety of frontline healthcare workers and the communities they are aiding. WHO and partners have also strengthened physical security in the treatment centres and accommodations of healthcare workers.Finding a balance between providing adequate operational protection to community members at risk of Ebola and healthcare workers while simultaneously winning the trust of communities remains an iterative learning process. WHO is constantly evolving the response efforts to address these operational challenges and will continue to step up collaboration with communities to increase acceptance on the ground.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.**Total cases and areas affected based during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert, and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances.

This rise is not unexpected and, in part, likely a result of the increased security challenges, including the recent direct attacks on treatment centers, and pockets of community mistrust, which slowed some response activities in affected areas for a few days.Katwa, Butembo, Masereka and Mandima account for over 80% of all cases in the last 21 days. A total of 97 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 38 of the 130 health areas affected to date (Table 1, Figure 2). This week, EVD was confirmed in an infant who died in Bunia Health Zone, but whose parents are in good health. This is the first confirmed case from this health zone; a previous case was identified from neighbouring Rwampara Health Zone in early February. While investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the infection, teams in place have rapidly implemented response activities including contact tracing, vaccination and heightened surveillance. Given the geographical spread of the epidemic and the high mobility in this region, the risk of Ebola spreading to unaffected areas or being reintroduced to previously affected areas remains high.Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas. There are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the ongoing challenges of insecurity caused by armed groups. Over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. To date, 89 855 people have been vaccinated. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on the rings where some families have not yet accepted the intervention.Field laboratories have sustained similar testing rates as previous weeks. On average, 1300 samples are tested weekly and more than 23 000 samples have been tested to date with a turnaround time of less than 48 hours. Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and Transit Centres continue to operate, and the Katwa Transit Centre is being scaled up by ALIMA to increase capacity to respond to the outbreak in that area. To date, 335 patients have received one of the four investigational therapeutics under the MEURI protocol (compassionate use), and 80 patients under the RCT protocol.In Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi health zones, response teams have continued to engage communities through various community dialogue platforms. Five community dialogue platforms have been organised in three health areas in Katwa, one health area in Butembo and one health area in Vuhovi. This initiative allows community members to participate and lead in decisions regarding Ebola response interventions in their localities. In other EVD-affected areas, ongoing activities include systematic collection of community feedback and responding to community concerns through adjustments of activities in consultation with community leaders and influencers. Community outreach activities are carried out in faith-based settings, market places, and schools with the collaboration of faith-based leaders and civil society groups (including women and youth). Civil society groups and community health volunteers also assist in the door-to-door community outreach activities on a regular basis.Since the beginning of the outbreak to 19 March 2019, 980 EVD cases1 (915 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (554) were female and 30% (293) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 130 of 339 health areas across 21 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 610 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) have been reported, and 317 patients have been discharged after treatment in ETCs.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community resistance and mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

During the last 21 days (20 February \u2013 12 March 2019), no new cases have been detected in 10 of the 20 health zones that have been affected during the outbreak (Figure 1). There has also been fewer new cases observed over the past five weeks compared to January 2019 and earlier in the outbreak (Figure 2).Currently, the greatest concern centres on the neighbouring urban areas of Katwa and Butembo, which continue to contribute about three-quarters of recent cases. Clusters in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been linked to chains of transmission in Katwa and Butembo, and have thus far been contained to limited local transmissions with relatively small numbers of cases. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 32 of the 125 health areas affected to date (Table 1). Risk of further chains of transmission and spread remain high, as highlighted by the recent spread to Lubero Health Zone, and reintroduction to Biena Health Zone following a prolonged period without new cases.Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas and there are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the challenges of ongoing insecurity caused by armed groups. For example, during the last 21 days in Katwa and Butembo, 88% of the 256 families with a family member who died and was suspected to have EVD, accepted the support from response teams to conduct a safe and dignified burial. Seventy-four new vaccination rings were launched, with over 90% of people eligible for vaccination accepting to do so, and over 90% of these participated in follow-up visits. A total of 5974 people (including 2159 health and frontline workers) consented and were vaccinated this period; overall 87,632 people have been vaccinated to date. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on 12 rings wherein the families have not yet accepted the intervention, and two other rings that are in the process of being defined. Seven field laboratories have remained fully operational, sustaining similar testing rates as previous weeks. During the past week, 1213 samples from new suspected cases, community deaths and previously confirmed cases were tested within 48 hours. Outreach teams made up mostly of local volunteers also met with 6000 households during the past week, building local knowledge of Ebola, and referring sick individuals to either Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) or other health facilities as appropriate. In the last two weeks, community dialogues were held in several villages in Katwa and Vuhovi to find ways in engaging community members to build trust and ownership in the Ebola response.Efforts to strengthen case finding and investigation, and contact tracing activities are also bearing fruit. Of 74 confirmed cases reported in the last 21 days, 83% (62 cases) have been epidemiologically linked to active chains of transmission; either listed as contacts at illness onset (47 cases) or linked retrospectively to other cases or health centre where they were likely exposed (15 cases). Investigations are ongoing to identify links for the remaining cases.Challenges include further attacks by armed groups on affected communities and ETCs, elements of community mistrust, and persistent delays in getting people into care in ETCs for various reasons. The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners continue to work actively to build community trust and participation in the response, while reinforcing security measures to protect patients and response teams. The ETC in Butembo has been rebuilt following two attacks and is treating patients again, and the Katwa Transit Centre remains operational.Since the beginning of the outbreak to 12 March 2019, 927 EVD cases1 (862 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (525) were female and 30% (280) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 125 of 319 health areas across 20 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 584 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 308 patients have been discharged from ETCs.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The latest assessment on 6 March 2019 concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. The outbreak has continued with a similar epidemiological profile to the last assessment. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties.

Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while small clusters continue simultaneously in some geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (13 February \u2013 5 March 2019), 76 new confirmed and probable cases have been reported from 31 health areas within nine health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (44), Butembo (17), Mandima (6), Masereka (3), Kalunguta (2), Beni (1), Vuhovi (1), Kyondo (1), and Rwampara (1). The emerging cluster in Mandima health zone is occurring in a previously unaffected village, with five of the recent cases epidemiologically linked and the sixth case likely exposed in Butembo; nonetheless, there remains a high risk of further spread. Similarly, recent cases (two confirmed and one probable) in Masereka stem from a Butembo chain of transmission. These events highlight the importance for response teams to remain active across all areas, including those with lower case incidence, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.As of 5 March, 907 EVD cases1 (841 confirmed and 66 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (514) were female and 30% (273) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 121 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Overall, 569 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 304 patients have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs). Although declining trends in case incidence are currently being observed, the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs (related as well to recent violent incidents), and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, all increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and continued spread.Following the attacks on two ETCs in Katwa and Butembo, patients were temporarily transferred to the Katwa Transit Centre. On 2 March, the Butembo ETC was rehabilitated and resumed treatment of EVD patients. Response teams are progressively resuming activities in all affected areas with the exception of two health areas where security and community resistance remain a challenge.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities.

As of 11 February, a total of 20 cases, 16 confirmed and 4 suspected, have been identified in nine states in the United States.As per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) case definition, a confirmed case is defined as Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase\u2013producing carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (VIM-CRPA) isolated from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the VIM-CRPA positive specimen. A suspect case is CRPA unavailable for mechanism testing or pending mechanism testing from a patient who had an invasive procedure in Mexico in the month prior to collection of the specimen.Of the 20 total cases, two were reported retrospectively and had dates of specimen collection in 2015 and 2017, while the remaining 18 cases had dates of specimen collection between 5 September 2018 and 24 January 2019. All cases were in travelers who received medical care from healthcare facilities in Tijuana, Mexico. Fifteen of the total cases reported having surgery, primarily for weight loss, at Grand View Hospital. Half of the total cases reported the use of the same medical tourism travel agency based in the United States to coordinate their surgical procedure in Mexico. Although most referred patients were from the United States and Canada, this medical tourism travel agency has reportedly referred patients from additional countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018.A total of 13 cases have been hospitalized in the United States for complications associated with VIM-CRPA infection following invasive procedures in Mexico; most presented with a surgical site infection. One patient with a bloodstream infection and several underlying comorbidities died. Of the 17 cases with available information on sex and age, 14 (82%) were female, and ages ranged from 29 to 62 years.A local investigation at Grand View Hospital identified reusable equipment that was not being appropriately processed, which poses a small but potential risk of transmission for bloodborne infections among patients.On 9 January 2019, the US-CDC issued a Travel Notice regarding cases of resistant P. aeruginosa infection linked to surgery at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, with a recommendation that US residents not undergo surgery (bariatric or other type) at Grand View Hospital until it is confirmed that VIM-CRPA is no longer spreading at the facility. On 22 January 2019, the US-CDC issued a notification recommending that individuals who had surgery at Grand View Hospital on or after 1 August 2018 talk to their healthcare provider about getting tested for the following bloodborne pathogens: hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).On 13 February 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) also issued a Public Health Notice regarding Canadian travelers who may have been exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria after having undergone surgical procedures in Tijuana, Mexico. In addition, Canadian travelers who had procedures at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, may also be at-risk for bloodborne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Given the possibility of exposure to these health risks, PHAC recommends that patients who have had surgery at Grand View Hospital or other medical facilities in Tijuana, and who are experiencing signs of an infection\u2014such as fever, redness, pus or swelling at the surgical incision site\u2014see a healthcare provider immediately. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their travel to Mexico and all medical care or surgeries they had while they were outside of Canada.Individuals in the United States with resistant P. aeruginosa infections following invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy) in Mexico have reported undergoing procedures at different healthcare facilities in Tijuana. One facility, Grand View Hospital, is associated with an ongoing outbreak of VIM-producing P. aeruginosa infections. Persons who underwent procedures at this healthcare facility may be infected or at-risk of developing VIM-producing P. aeruginosa infections. There is a risk of spreading resistant P. aeruginosa by patients returning to their home countries, particularly in healthcare settings. A single medical tourism travel agency based in the United States reported referring individuals from different countries to Grand View Hospital since 1 August 2018; however, persons from additional countries may also be affected.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.WHO encourages sharing this outbreak information with relevant public health authorities and clinicians, to enable timely recognition of potential cases that could be related to this outbreak. WHO recommends implementing infection prevention and control measures, as described in the \u201cGuidelines for the prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in health care facilities\u201d, to prevent the dissemination of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in healthcare settings, available at the link below.As antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, including in the Region of the Americas, WHO encourages States Parties to increase efforts for early detection of resistant microorganisms and to implement prevention and control actions for containing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance is a key component of prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and should be strengthened, along with laboratory capacity, to support the detection of infection caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria and to inform infection prevention and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship. Treatment policies should be based on both antibiotic susceptibility testing when possible and on the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance when empiric treatment is prescribed. Clinicians must be updated on treatment recommendations as these evolve due to very dynamic changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns.WHO recommends against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Mexico based on the information available for this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Mexico", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/04-march-2019-mers-oman-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-03-04", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Oman", "main_text": "4 March 2019Between 12 and 18 February 2019, the National IHR Focal Point of Oman reported eight additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Four cases were reported from South Sharquia governorate, and four cases were reported from North Batinah governorate where a MERS-CoV cluster was recently identified. Details of the additional eight cases can be found in the attached excel sheet.Since 27 January 2019, a total of 13 MERS cases were reported from Oman, including nine from North Batinah (five cases were previously reported in the Disease outbreak News 11 February 2019) and four from South Sharquia.An investigation into the exposure history to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to symptom onset in all eight cases is currently ongoing.From 2012 through 18 February 2019, a total of 2357 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, along with 820 associated deaths, have been reported to WHO globally. The first reported MERS infection in Oman was reported in 2013. Since then, a total of 24 cases and seven deaths have been reported.The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Whole genome sequencing of available human specimens of patients is being conducted. As of 21 February, all identified contacts (family and health workers) of confirmed MERS patients have been screened, including 69 contacts from North Batinah patients and 57 contacts from South Sharqiyah patients. Tracing and follow-up of these contacts is ongoing by the Ministry of Health for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV. All contacts have been sampled and have tested negative for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR.The Ministry of Agriculture has conducted an investigation of dromedaries at the farms of one of the patients. Results of this investigation are pending.The Ministry of Health has strengthened infection prevention and control measures in emergency departments, especially in triaging areas. Health education and awareness materials were produced and disseminated to health care staff, patients and visitors.Family members of MERS-CoV infected patients have been contacted and advised about the virus and on measures to ensure personal protection to prevent infection. Efforts in improving public health awareness among the general public has been strengthened through greater messaging in the media.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans, especially from close unprotected contact with infected patients. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment of MERS-CoV. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (e.g. in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS infections have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS infected patient to another individual have been documented.MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with dromedary camels when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, and refrain from eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regards to this event, and does not currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions at this time.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Oman", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON134", "date_of_publication": "2019-02-28", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity.

Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case incidence and contact tracing activity, as well as in areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission. Following attacks this week on the treatment centres in Katwa and Butembo, WHO is working with partners to ensure the safety of the patients and staff. These incidents are disruptive to the response on many levels and can also hamper surveillance activities in the field.As of 26 February, 879 EVD cases1 (814 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (499) were female and 30% (264) were children aged less than 18 years.

National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread.

Two genetically-linked VDPV1 viruses were isolated from a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) with onset of paralysis on 27 November 2018 and in a healthy community contact, a child whose stool sample was collected on 24 January 2019. The location of this healthy child, with the VDPV isolation, is in a remote village, approximately 3\u20134 km away from the AFP case with onset of paralysis on 27 November 2018. Even though this province shares a border with Papua New Guinea, this outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 outbreak currently affecting its neighbouring country.WHO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health (MoH) and local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation, a thorough risk assessment and planning an outbreak response. The exact extent and timing of the outbreak response is being finalized. Initial outbreak response immunization (ORI) has been conducted in Yahukimo district and 5718 children under 15 years of age have been immunized with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). Disease surveillance, including conducting retrospective and active searches for additional acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, has been further strengthened in community health centres, hospitals and other health facilities including all districts and cities in Papua province. Surveillance has also been strengthened at entry and exit ports and monitoring notification and reporting through the Early Warning, Alert, and Response System (EWARS) has been reinforced. Other provinces have been alerted to improve immunization and AFP surveillance.The most recent National Immunisation Day (NID) conducted in Indonesia was in March 2016 using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) (in advance of the trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV switch), and Papua province conducted a bivalent OPV/measles/rubella Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) in late 2018. In addition, in response to the recent cVDPV1 outbreak in Papua New Guinea, MoH Indonesia had already established border vaccination posts and initiated environmental surveillance in Papua province. They had also conducted a simulation exercise to test their polio outbreak response plan. However, the polio vaccination coverage in Papua province remains low (2016 SIA coverage: 77% and 2018 SIA coverage: 72%; overall OPV4 coverage: 68.2% in 2017 and 40.8% in 2018).The detection of cVDPVs underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any polioviruses. These events also underscore the risk posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.The overall risk is assessed as moderate at the national level due to the sub-optimal polio vaccination coverage and surveillance quality in Papua province of Indonesia. The population density in the highlands, from where the virus has been isolated, is relatively low and population movement from that area to other provinces not significant. Locally in Papua province, there is limited capacity within existing resources for implementing response measures.At the regional level despite proximity with Papua New Guinea the overall risk is assessed to be low as there is limited cross border population movement from the affected area; however, virological analysis indicates that the virus may have been possibly circulating for a few years with immunization coverage being low in neighbouring areas. Jayapura, a nearby district that has high international population movement has not had any persons test positive for cVDPV. At the global level, the overall risk is assessed as low due to generally high polio vaccine coverage, established AFP surveillance systems and availability of technical expertise for polio control.This risk will be continuously assessed and could be reviewed according to the evolution of the situation.Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPVs) are rare but well documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. The emergence of VDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.It is important that all countries, in particular those with persons who frequently travel and have contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health (http://www.who.int/ith/en/) recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission (i.e. those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine derived poliovirus), travellers from polio-free countries should ensure that they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. In addition, they should be given another one-time booster dose of polio vaccine if the OPV or IPV vaccine series were completed more than 12 months previously.Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e. persons who spend more than four weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. In addition, they should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio-free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months, should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication such as adequate vaccination of international travellers; intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross border efforts. State should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.

Between 29 January and 13 February 2019, 39 cases of MERS-CoV infection, including four deaths, were reported. At the time of writing, this outbreak remains ongoing. Human-to-human transmission has occurred between the index patient and health care workers, patients in the emergency department and intensive care unit (ICU) of Hospital A, and from patients to household contacts. As of 13 February, nine health care workers have been infected. Descriptions of the outbreak are based on information WHO has received as of 13 February 2019; further updates will be provided as they become available.Details regarding each of the cases are provided in the file linked below.From 2012 through 13 February 2019, a total of 2 345 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, along with 817 associated deaths, have been reported to WHO globally. The number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases globally reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH) has launched a full-scaled investigation of the outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir, including identification of all household and healthcare worker contacts of confirmed patients. As of 13 February, a total of 350 contacts have been identified, including 230 household contacts and 120 healthcare worker contacts. All identified contacts will continue to be monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV.Currently, symptomatic and high-risk exposure contacts have been tested for MERS-CoV infection by RT-PCR at least once and many contacts of known patients have been tested repeatedly. Any secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to WHO. As of 13 February, the MoH believes that the possible active human-to-human transmission is minimized. The latest cases represent contacts who initially tested negative for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR, but were confirmed positive in subsequent repeat testing. WHO expects more cases epidemiologically linked to known cases to be reported.Within the health care facilities with high risk of MERS-CoV transmission, infection prevention and control measures have been enhanced, including intensive mandatory on-the-job training on infection control measures for all healthcare workers in emergency room and ICU. Disinfection has been carried out in the emergency room and ICU of Hospital A, and respiratory triage has been enforced in all healthcare facilities in the Riyadh region. Additional hospital staff are also mobilized to support infection control activities. At this time, Hospital A is fully operational.The MoH media department has launched an awareness campaign targeting Wadi Aldawasir city with special focus on camel owners and camel-related activities.The Ministry of Agriculture is testing dromedaries in the Wadi Aldwasir area. Three dromedaries have tested positive via PCR and these animals were removed from the local market. Movement in and out of the camel market has also been restricted. Camels owned by confirmed human cases were quarantined regardless of testing results as a precaution. Full genome sequencing of available human and dromedary specimens will be conducted.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.As of 13 February, 39 cases have been identified and reported as part of the Wadi Aldwasir outbreak. At the time of writing, contact follow-up is ongoing. It is likely that more cases resulting from human-to-human transmission may be reported as part of this outbreak. The occurrence of this nosocomial transmission is deeply concerning. However, the epidemiologic patterns are not unusual and there are no signs so far that suggest further propagation of the outbreak. Human-to-human transmission between patients and health care workers, between patients sharing spaces in health care facilities, and from patients to household members, can occur when there are delays in isolation of suspected cases, inadequate infection and control measures, and late case management.The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO\u2019s overall risk assessment of MERS-CoV. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to infected dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of raw camel milk), or other human cases (e.g. in a health care setting). WHO will continue to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information. Results of the completed epidemiological investigation, as well as full genome sequencing of available dromedary and human specimens are currently pending. These results will provide information of the extent of dromedary-to-human and human-to-human transmission in this outbreak.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS-CoV infected patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS-CoV infections have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected patient to another individual have been documented.MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people who are immunocompromised or have underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, or chronic lung disease. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with dromedary camels when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should also be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, and refrain from eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regards to this event, and does not currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions at this time.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON131", "date_of_publication": "2019-02-21", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (30 January \u2013 19 February 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 40 health areas within 12 health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).1No new cases have been reported from the Beni in the last three weeks. This is a significant achievement given the previous intensity of the outbreak in this area. Elsewhere, trends in the case incidence (Figure 2) have been encouraging; however, other indicators (such as the continued high proportion of community deaths, persistent delays in case detection, documented local travel amongst many cases, and relatively low numbers of cases among contacts under surveillance) suggest a high risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case and contact tracing activity, as with areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.As of 19 February, 848 EVD cases2 (783 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (485) were female and 30% (258) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Ongoing cleaning of case databases this past week corrected to the number of deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) thus far; overall 529 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) and 257 survivors have been reported to date.To complement ongoing response activities, the Ministry of Health is establishing a Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma. The new Centre will support the coordination and monitoring of the operations in close collaboration with sub-coordination teams working across all affected areas. The implementation of the Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma will not impact on the response capacity in the field, with WHO and partners continuing to maintain full-scale operations in Beni, Butembo and Bunia, as well as a strong presence in all affected Health Zones, to ensure the effectiveness of field operations.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, see:1\u00a0Excludes probable cases reported following retrospective reclassification of cases with illness onset prior to the reporting period.

Since the declaration, a total of 26 confirmed cVDPV1 cases have been reported in the following nine provinces: Eastern Highlands (six), Enga (five), East Sepik (four), Madang (three), Morobe (three), Jiwaka (two), Gulf (one), Southern Highlands (one), and National Capital District (NCD) (one). The last laboratory-confirmed case reported having experienced the onset of paralysis in late October 2018. Environmental surveillance continues on a bimonthly basis in Port Moresby and Lae to complement active acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case search efforts.To date, there have been five rounds of Supplementary Immunisation Activities (SIA) conducted from July to December 2018. Consultants from WHO and UNICEF have been deployed to provide technical support during pre-campaign preparations and implementation to ensure high quality SIAs and improve AFP case detection. The first round of SIA targeted children under five years of age in three high-risk provinces. The second round included children under five years of age in all nine provinces. The third and fourth rounds of SIA included National Immunisation Days (NIDs) which were aimed at children less than 15 years of age and achieved a coverage of 93% and 97% respectively. The fifth round of SIA was a sub-national campaign conducted in four priority provinces (NCD, Central, Enga, and Angoram district in East Sepik province). Planning is currently ongoing for additional NIDs in 2019.AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced and all provinces are now reporting cases of suspected AFP. As Papua New Guinea shares a border with Papua Province, Indonesia, cross-border surveillance and immunization has been discussed. A SIA has also been implemented in Papua Province, Indonesia in addition to the strengthening of surveillance efforts.WHO is working with partners to support the Government of Papua New Guinea to undertake appropriate outbreak response measures in accordance with the requirements under the temporary recommendations of the IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus and standard operating procedures of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread of poliovirus from Papua New Guinea to be low.Circulating VDPVs are rare, though well-documented strains of poliovirus can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. While five SIA rounds have been conducted in 2018, there remains a need for additional SIAs/NIDs in areas of low-coverage to strengthen routine immunization programmes. The risk of further spread of cVDPV1 within the country remains a great concern due to poor routine immunization coverage. The emergence of cVDPV1 strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine immunization coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.On 5 May 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared the international spread of poliovirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations [IHR 2005], issued Temporary Recommendations to reduce the international spread of poliovirus, and requested a reassessment of this situation by the Emergency Committee every three months.WHO emphasizes the need for full implementation of outbreak response measures of the internationally-agreed standard and WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.It is important that all countries, particularly, those with frequent travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas to strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health (http://www.who.int/ith/en/) recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of bivalent oral poliovirus (bOPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Travellers should be provided with a written record of such vaccination, preferably using the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Some polio-free countries may require travellers who are resident in polio affected countries to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa.

Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.Although Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.With twelve confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.Prevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections.

This case comes one month after the last reported case in Ituri Province; underscoring the high risks of reintroduction to previously affected areas, as well as the potential for spread to new ones.As of 12 February, 823 EVD cases2 (762 confirmed and 61 probable) have been reported, including 517 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 63%). Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 118 of 287 health areas across 18 health zones, of which 37 health areas have reported a case in the last 21 days. Thus far, 283 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. One new health worker infection was reported in Katwa. To date, a total of 68 health workers have been infected.Main challenges this past week primarily pertain to community mistrust, particularly in Katwa, and the difficulty in encouraging community members to be more proactive in reporting suspected cases, presenting early to ETCs for treatment, and participating in community-based prevention and response efforts. However, in the face of these protracted challenges, response strategies have demonstrated to be effective in curtailing the spread of EVD. Fostering greater community trust by strengthening engagement with its members remains a top priority for response teams.On 13 February, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched the Strategic Response Plan 3 (SRP 3). The plan lays out the response strategy, objectives and budget requirements for the MoH, WHO, and all implementing partners for the next six months (February through July 2019). SRP 3 takes into account recommendations from operational reviews, and builds on a series of new strategic directions that capitalize on lessons learned under the scope of SRP 2. Activities laid out aim to stop the transmission of EVD in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, and prevent its spread to other provinces and neighbouring countries.WHO remains confident that this outbreak can be successfully brought to an end through strategies outlined in SRP 3. To achieve the goals set out by the plan, MoH, WHO, and partners are appealing for US$ 148 million. WHO and partners count on the continued support of the international community to provide the required funding in order to stop this outbreak.*Map based on the latest available detailed line lists (data as of 11 February 2019), and excludes cases reported after this date, as well as cases with delayed/missing village or health area details.

The last review conducted on 7 February 2019, outlines the high risk the EVD outbreak poses at the national and regional levels, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, see:1\u00a0Excludes newly probable cases from Katwa (7) and Komanda (5), who died in November and December 2018 and were reported during the period of 21 January to 10 February following a retrospective re-classification of cases.2\u00a0Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/11-february-2019-mers-oman-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-02-11", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Oman", "main_text": "11 February 2019From 27 January and 31 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Oman reported five cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. All five laboratory confirmed cases are females from the same family and range in age from 30-59 years. The source of infection in this cluster is under investigation in Oman and four of the five cases appear to be secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission. While all cases did not report direct contact with dromedary camels, they resided on a farm where dromedary camels and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is testing the dromedary camels. Details of these five cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).Including these five additional cases, a total of 16 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by Oman since 2013. Prior to this cluster of cases, the last case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Oman was in March 2018.Globally, as of 8 February 2019, 2 311 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 811 related deaths have been reported to WHO1.For all cases, investigation of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Ministry of Health officials in Oman have established a contact list of healthcare worker and familial contacts in North Batinah Governorate. As of 4 February, a total of 60 familial contacts have been identified, with 26 contacts classified as high-risk. All household members of MERS-CoV cases have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and tested negative, except one case reported above, who tested positive on 28 January. As of 4 February, a total of 119 healthcare worker contacts have been identified. All high-risk healthcare worker contacts have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and all have tested negative. All identified contacts are monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV infection.While no direct contact with dromedaries has been reported by any of the cases, they resided on a farm where dromedaries and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is investigating the dromedary farms. Samples were collected and initial screening results for have tested negative for MERS-CoV. Further results are pending. Healthcare workers were educated and provided a refresher training course in infection prevention and control measures. Family members were educated about MERS-CoV and personal and respiratory hygiene advice was provided.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be or potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.1This global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date.

The expansion of the historical area of yellow fever transmission to areas in the south-east of the country in areas along the Atlantic coast previously considered risk-free led to two waves of transmission (Figure 1). One during the 2016\u20132017 seasonal period, with 778 human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017\u20132018 seasonal period, with 1376 human cases, including 483 deaths.From December 2018 through January 2019, 361 confirmed human cases, including eight deaths, have been reported in 11 municipalities of two states of Brazil. In the southern part of S\u00e3o Paulo state, seven municipalities:El dorado (16 cases), Jacupiranga (1 case), Iporanga (7 cases), Cananeia (3 cases), Cajati (2), Pariquera-A\u00e7u (1), and Sete Barras (1) reported confirmed cases. In the same state, additional cases in Vargem (1) and Serra Negra (1) municipalities were confirmed on the border with Minas Gerais State. Additionally, two cases have been confirmed in the municipalities of Antonina and Adrian\u00f3polis, located in the eastern part of Paran\u00e1 State. These are the first confirmed yellow fever cases reported since 2015 from Paran\u00e1, a populous state with an international border. Among these confirmed cases, 89% (32/36) are male, the median age is 43 years, and at least 64% (23/36) are rural workers.Human cases reported so far during the current 2018\u20132019 period (July 2018 to Jan 2019) in nine municipalities in S\u00e3o Paulo State, as well as the confirmation of human cases and epizootic due to yellow fever in the state of Paran\u00e1, mark the beginning of what could be a third wave and a progression of the outbreak towards the Southeast and South regions of the country (Figure 2). While too early to determine if this year will show the high numbers of human cases observed in the last two large seasonal peaks, there is indication that the virus transmission is continuing to spread in a southerly direction and in areas with low population immunity.Source: Data published by the Brazil Ministry of Health (2016\u20132018, as of 15 December 2018) and the S\u00e3o Paulo State Secretariat of Health (22 December 2018 through 26 January 2019) and reproduced by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO)From 1 July 2018 through 18 January 2019, 25 confirmed epizootics were reported in five federal entities: S\u00e3o Paulo (13), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2) and Parana (1). In the last four weeks epizootics have been confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo and Parana states. Additionally, the Paran\u00e1 Secretariat of Health reported that tests performed on dead monkeys in Antonina, on the Paran\u00e1 coast, were positive for yellow fever. Given the gradual geographical expansion of the epizootic wave that Brazil has faced during the last two seasonal periods, the country has had to adapt its immunization policies for yellow fever. The number of areas with recommended vaccination has increased from 3526 municipalities in 2010 to 4469 (out of 55702) municipalities in 2018. In line with the World Health Organization guidelines, Brazil has adopted a single dose vaccination scheme for yellow fever since April 2017.During the 2017\u20132018 season, Brazil adopted the use of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination to respond to outbreaks and the risk of urbanization of yellow fever, especially in large cities. This strategy was implemented in 77 municipalities with the greatest risk for yellow fever in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo (54 municipalities), Rio de Janeiro (15 municipalities), and Bah\u00eda (8 municipalities).As of 29 September 2018, preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever indicate that 13.3 million people in S\u00e3o Paulo, 6.5 million in Rio de Janeiro, and 1.85 million in Bah\u00eda states were vaccinated, which represents vaccination coverage of 53.6%, 55.6% and 55.0%, respectively3 .Furthermore, data from the Brazil Ministry of Health indicates that vaccination coverage of 95% and greater has been reached in 13% (57/435) of municipalities considered to be at-risk in Paran\u00e1, 21% (113/531) of municipalities at-risk in Rio Grande do Sul, 19% (155/838) of municipalities at-risk in S\u00e3o Paulo, and 9% (38/428) of municipalities at-risk in Santa Catarina.Brazil has recommended additional supplementary vaccination of approximately 3 million persons in Sao Paulo State in urban areas in response to the current season, albeit not yet determined whether full or fractional dose. In January 2019, vaccinations also began in 36 Quilombo communities. Additionally, the state and affected municipalities developed a task force who have targeted vaccination of 28 299 unvaccinated additional persons in coming days in municipalities of Cajati, Iporanga, and Barra do Turvo.Further transmission is expected in the coming months based on seasonal patterns. Recent human cases of yellow fever during the current seasonal cycle have been reported in S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states in Southeast Brazil.The preliminary results of the vaccination coverages in municipalities from Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Santa Catarina states suggests a high proportion of persons remaining at-risk and the necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.The geographical distribution of human cases and epizootics from the current and previous two seasonal cycles suggests southward movement of the virus, which presents further risk to the states of Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina, as no epizootics or human cases were confirmed in recent years prior. Furthermore, these areas have ecosystems favorable for yellow fever transmission and borders with other countries such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.During the previous season cycle, human yellow fever cases were reported among travelers, though to date, most imported cases have been reported in countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter). These reports illustrate the importance of maintaining high levels of awareness, especially for international travelers from areas with favorable ecosystems for yellow fever transmission.To date, yellow fever transmission by Aedes aegypti has not been documented, however the high incidence observed in the last two seasons may reflect the increased contact of sylvatic environments (vectors and non-human primates) and under-protected populations in urban or peri-urban settings. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016\u20132017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated Haemagogus mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever, indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu\u00eata and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. Currently, based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.On 25 January 2019, PAHO/WHO alerted4 Member States about the beginning of the seasonal period for yellow fever and therefore, the highest risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans. Thus, PAHO/WHO advises Member States with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.WHO recommends vaccination of international travellers above nine months of age going to Brazil. The updated areas at-risk for yellow fever transmission and the related recommendations for vaccination of international travellers were updated by WHO on 3 May 20185; the map of revised areas at risk and yellow fever vaccination recommendations is available on the WHO International Travel and Health website.Yellow fever can easily be prevented through immunization, provided that vaccination is administered at least 10 days before travel. Yellow fever vaccination is safe, highly effective and provides life-long protection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.Awareness of the signs and symptoms of yellow fever are recommended for anyone living or traveling in areas at risk for yellow fever transmission. Persons experiencing symptoms are encouraged to seek healthcare quickly.WHO recommends against the application of any general travel or trade restrictions to Brazil based on the information available for this event.Information on the yellow fever situation in Brazil and other countries in the Americas is published regularly on the PAHO/WHO website and on the Brazil Ministry of Health website:For more information on yellow fever, please see:1The probable place of infection for one confirmed human case is currently under investigation.2Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, per its acronym in Portuguese)3It should be noted that these figures include 11.3 million people vaccinated in the three states prior to the start of the mass vaccination campaign, which began on 25 January 2018 in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and on 19 February 2018 in Bah\u00eda.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Brazil", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON128", "date_of_publication": "2019-02-07", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues with relatively high numbers of cases reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), and some encouraging signs. Katwa and Butembo health zones remain the epicentres of the outbreak, reporting 71% of cases in the last three weeks, with smaller clusters continuing to occur concurrently across a geographically dispersed area.As of 5 February, 789 EVD cases1 (735 confirmed and 54 probable) have been reported, including 488 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 267 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. Among cases with available information regarding age and sex, 58% (454/788) were female, and 30% (232/786) were aged less than 18 years; including 116 children under five years. Five new health worker infections were reported in Katwa (4) and Kalunguta (1); overall 67 health workers have been affected to date.During the last 21 days (16 January \u2013 5 February 2019), 119 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (75), Butembo (9), Beni (8), Kyondo (5), Kayna (5), Oicha (4), Manguredjipa (4), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Mabalako (2), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Vuhovi (1)2. Current epidemiological analyses points to nosocomial transmission due to poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, persistent delays in detection and isolation of new cases, frequent community deaths (and subsequent contact with deceased), and transmission within family and community networks, as the main drivers of ongoing disease transmission. Insecurity and pockets of community resistance have continuously stifled efforts to combat these risks; nevertheless, response teams remain committed to actively strengthening community trust and participation in all affected areas, and are beginning to observe tangible improvements in Katwa and elsewhere.Komanda Health Zone has recently passed the most risky transmission period, with the last confirmed case reported on 11 January and all contacts completing the minimum follow-up period; however, a high degree of vigilance will need to be maintained to rapidly detect potential flare-ups and reintroductions here and in other previously affected areas.1 Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.2The five probable cases from Komanda (all of whom died in November 2018), were reported during the week of 21 \u2013 27 January 2019 following a retrospective re-classification of cases.The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO reviewed its risk assessment on 9 January 2019 for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low.

In 2018, a total of 986 suspected and confirmed cases of dengue including 13 deaths have been reported. The number of reported dengue cases in 2018 was 4.5 times higher than that reported in 2017 (215 cases including six deaths). Cases reported to date for 2019 exceed the epidemic threshold (Figure 2).According to historic data, Jamaica reported a major outbreak in 2016, when 2297 cases of dengue infection including two deaths were reported. Dengue virus 3 (DENV3) and DENV4 circulations were confirmed at the time.By the end of 2018, the largest number of reported cases were notified by Kingston and Saint Andrew parishes. In 2019 so far, the largest proportion of cases have been reported by Saint Catherine parish.Laboratory tests have identified DENV3 as the dengue serotype currently circulating.In January 2019, some countries and territories in the Caribbean region, such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint Martin, reported an increase in dengue cases. Of note, in Saint Martin and Guadeloupe, serotype DENV1 is currently circulating.Source: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHO*Cumulative suspected/ presumed/ confirmed cases = 1325Source: Jamaica Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHOJamaica has been reporting dengue cases since 1990 and throughout 2018; however, an increase has been observed since December 2018 exceeding the epidemic threshold. Similar large increases were reported in 2010 (2887 cases), 2012 (4670 cases), and 2016 (2297 cases). The increase of dengue in the Caribbean islands may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and require comprehensive risk communication.On 21 November 2018, PAHO/WHO alerted Member States about an increase in dengue cases in countries and territories in the Americas and recommended coordinated actions both inside and outside of the health sector, including prioritizing activities to prevent transmission of dengue as well as deaths due to this disease.PAHO/WHO further advises to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue, available at the link below.There is no specific treatment for disease due to dengue; therefore, prevention is the most important step to reduce the risk of dengue infection. WHO recommends proper and timely case management of dengue cases. Surveillance should continue to be strengthened within all affected areas and at the national level. Key public health communication messages should continue to be provided to reduce the risk of transmission of dengue in the population.In addition, integrated vector management (IVM) activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposures. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction, and chemical control measures), as well as strategies to protect individuals and households. Where indoor biting occurs, household insecticide aerosol products, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity. Household fixtures such as window and door screens and air conditioning can also reduce biting. Since Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, personal protective measures such as use of clothing that minimizes skin exposure during daylight hours is recommended. Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing. The use of repellents must be in strict accordance with label instructions. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection for those who sleep during the day (e.g. infants, the bedridden, and night-shift workers) as well as during the night to prevent mosquito bites.WHO does not recommend any general travel or trade restrictions be applied based on the information available for this event.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Dengue fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Jamaica", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON125", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-31", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), despite persistent challenges around security and community mistrust impacting response measures. Relatively high numbers of cases were reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), mostly driven by the outbreak in Katwa Health Zone; the current focus of large scale response activities. Smaller clusters continue to be reported beyond Katwa Health Zone, including from Beni and Oicha; however, teams have quickly and systematically responded to these clusters to prevent onward transmission and guard against further geographical expansion of the outbreak. Teams are also working actively to strengthen community trust and participation in all affected areas.As we approach six months since declaration of the outbreak, there have been a total of 752 EVD cases1 (698 confirmed and 54 probable) reported, including 465 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%) as of 29 January 2019. Thus far, 259 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (439/750) were female, and 30% (224/749) were aged less than 18 years; including 115 children under 5 years.During the last 21 days (9 January \u2013 29 January 2019), 118 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (80), Beni (9), Butembo (7), Kayina (5), Manguredjipa (4), Oicha (4), Biena (3), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Komanda (1) and Vuhovi (1). In addition, five historic probable cases from Komanda Health Zone were reported during the past week with illness onset dating back to November 2018.The outbreak in Katwa and Butembo health zones is partly being driven by nosocomial transmission events in private and public health centres. Since 1 December 2018, 86% (125/145) of cases in these areas had visited or worked in a health care facility before or after their onset of illness. Of those, 21% (30/145) reported contact with a health care facility before their onset of illness, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. In Katwa during the past 3 weeks (since 9 January), 49 health structures were identified where confirmed cases were hospitalised, including nine health centres where nosocomial transmission potentially occurred. Moreover, during the same period, eight new health care worker (HCW) infections were reported in Katwa; overall, 65 HCWs have been infected to date.

A test-of-cure (TOC) was carried out and she was found to have cleared the pathogen.The second case, a heterosexual female who attended sexual health services in the United Kingdom in November 2018. She reported a casual male sexual contact in the United Kingdom in November 2018 who was known to be in Ibiza, Spain from June until September 2018.The case was treated empirically with ceftriaxone 1 g. A TOC was carried out and she had not cleared the pathogen. She was then given gentamicin 240 mg (intramuscular) and azithromycin 2 mg (oral). She was given intravenous ertapenem for three days as the symptoms were not resolved. A TOC was carried out afterwards and she was found to have cleared the pathogen.The two isolates are resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC 1.0 mg/L) and have intermediate susceptibility to azithromycin (MIC 0.5 mg/L). The isolates are also resistant to cefixime, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, but are susceptible to spectinomycin. These isolates differ from the case previously reported in March 2018 by the United Kingdom and the two cases reported by Australia in April 2018, which had high-level resistance to azithromycin.Public Health England had set up an incident management team to coordinate the investigations and communication, ensure contacts are traced and spread contained. Since there is a probable epidemiological link to sexual encounters with United Kingdom citizens who have travelled to Ibiza, Spain, the United Kingdom informed Spain about these cases via the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) of the European Union.Public Health England promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including: the creation of an incident management team for coordinating the response, outbreak investigations, contact tracing, surveillance and risk communication.Public Health services in the Balearic Islands and in Ibiza, Spain have been informed about this public health alert related to United Kingdom citizens infected with XDR N. gonorrhoeae who travelled to Ibiza. Treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Ibiza is included in services provided by the Public Health Service of the Balearic Islands and diagnosis is carried out at the laboratory of the main public hospital in Ibiza. Currently, there is no strain of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Ibiza presenting the resistance pattern described by the United Kingdom.Further investigations are needed to confirm the epidemiological link, the source of transmission and identify sexual partners of contacts of the United Kingdom cases, both in the United Kingdom and in Spain. Further public health control measures will be considered after information about possible sexual partners of United Kingdom contacts of the cases is made available by the Public Health England.This is the fourth report of XDR N. gonorrhoeae infection in the United Kingdom. These current cases are resistant to ceftriaxone and have intermediate susceptibility to azithromycin, which increasingly threatens the dual therapy for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone 250\u2009mg and azithromycin 1 g) recommended by WHO.Since the majority of gonorrhoea cases are asymptomatic, spread of resistant gonorrhoea strains is possible and can spread quickly in high risk populations. For these two cases there is an epidemiological link to sexual encounters with United Kingdom citizens in Ibiza, Spain, or United Kingdom citizens who have been in Ibiza, which indicates potential international spread of this resistant gonorrhoea strain. This must be done to implement appropriate public health measures and interrupt transmission of the infection, measures include: strengthening gonorrhoea antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and ensuring timely reporting.Contact tracing and response measures, including condom promotion, have been taken by Public Health England and the risk for potential further transmission in the United Kingdom by these two cases is currently considered to be low.To make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection, two overlapping goals must be met: broad-based control of drug resistance and control of gonococcal infection. Both should be approached in the wider contexts of global control of antimicrobial resistance. For gonococcal infections, the public health approach must build upon lessons learnt and put the following points into action:For more information about antimicrobial resistance or STIs, please see the following:References:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Gonococcal infection"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "United Kingdom of Great Britain ", "location": ""}, {"country": "Northern Ireland", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/25-january-2019-polio-mozambique-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-25", "headline": "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Mozambique", "main_text": "25 January 2019On 17 January 2019, two genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were reported from Molumbo district, Zambezia province, Mozambique. The first one, was from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on 21 October 2018, a six-year old girl with no history of vaccination, and the second isolate was from a community contact of the first case, a child aged one-year old.WHO and partners at the regional and country level are assisting the Ministry of Health and local public health authorities to conduct a thorough field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological), to assess the extent and original source of circulation of this virus more clearly, and to further plan and support the implementation of an outbreak response as appropriate, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.While national routine oral polio vaccine type 3 (OPV3) immunization coverage in 2017 was estimated at 80%, population immunity gaps remain at subnational levels, especially in Zamb\u00e9zia province (with 60% OPV3 coverage).WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be high due to a decline in population immunity to type 2 poliovirus and the risk of international spread to be medium due to ongoing population movements.The detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation and underscores the risk posed by any medium to low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniform high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission, travellers from polio-free countries should ensure that they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. Travellers to polio-infected areas who completed an OPV or IPV vaccine series more than 12 months previously should be given another one-time booster dose of polio vaccine. Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries (i.e. those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine derived poliovirus) and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e. persons who spend more than four weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. Travellers from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within four weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication such as adequate vaccination of international travellers; intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross border efforts.In addition, the Committee emphasized that states infected with cVDPV2 should encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. States should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. The Committee also noted the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections and recommended that States should consider requesting vaccines from the global monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2.

The number of reported cases increased during recent weeks, most notably from the Katwa health zone where response teams have faced pockets of community mistrust. The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area. Teams are working actively to build community trust and scale up response activities around these new clusters.Figure 1 shows that as of 22 January 2019, there have been a total of 713 EVD cases1 (664 confirmed and 49 probable), including 439 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 247 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), with many having enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (420/710) of cases were female, and 30% (214/708) were aged less than 18 years; including 108 infants and children under 5 years. Sixty-one healthcare workers have been infected to date.During the last 21 days (2 January \u2013 22 January 2019), 102 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (62), Butembo (12), Oicha (6), Kayina (5), Beni (2), Manguredjipa (3), Kyondo (3), Kalungata (2), Komanda (1), Musienene (2), Biena (2), Mabalako (1), and Vuhovi (1). The current outbreak hotspots of Butembo and Katwa encompass an urban area with a population of approximately one million people. Of the 148 cases reported in Katwa to date, less than half (55/148) were registered as contacts at the time of illness onset. Moreover, 10% (14/148) of these cases comprised of healthcare workers, and among those with available information, 42% (45/107) reported having attended a funeral in the weeks prior to illness onset. Collectively, these figures suggest that the observed increase in Katwa is being driven by a combination of both healthcare facility and community-based transmissions. Health protection and control measures such as infection prevention and control in health centers, vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, and safe and dignified burial practices, are being strengthened to interrupt the chains of transmission.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Between 28 October 2018 \u2013 20 January of 2019, a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS, including 11 deaths have been reported in Epuy\u00e9n, Chubut Province. Epuy\u00e9n has a population of approximately 2 000 persons, and Chubut Province is located in Patagonia in southern Argentina.The index case had environmental exposure prior to symptom onset on 2 November, and subsequently attended a party on 3 November. Six cases who also attended the party experienced the onset of symptoms between 20-27 November 2018. An additional 17 cases, all of whom were epidemiologically-linked to previously confirmed cases, experienced symptom onset between 7 December 2018 and 3 January 2019 (Figure 1). Potential human-to-human transmission is currently under investigation.Of the confirmed cases, 59% were female, and had an incubation period ranging from 8 to 31 days. Approximately 50% of these confirmed cases reported symptoms within the past three weeks. Cases were confirmed by ELISA IgM u-captura or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).As of 17 January 2019, a total of 98 asymptomatic contacts have been identified and are being monitored for the potential development of symptoms.In Argentina, four endemic regions have been identified: North (Salta, Jujuy), Centro (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre R\u00edos), Northeast (Misiones) and Sur (Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, and Chubut). Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 100 confirmed cases were registered annually, with the provinces of Buenos Aires, Salta, and Jujuy having the highest numbers of cases. Between 2013 and 2018, 114 confirmed deaths from hantavirus were reported in Argentina, with a case-fatality rate of 18.6%, though this figure was close to 40% for some provinces in the southern region of the country.In Chile, one of the confirmed cases was a healthcare worker who resides in Palena Province, Los Lagos Region, and reported experiencing symptoms on 2 January 2019. The case had a travel history to Epuy\u00e9n for one day in mid-November, and later hosted and cared for a confirmed case from Epuy\u00e9n while she was in her prodromal phase. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Los Lagos Region in 2019. During 2018, there were eight cases of hantavirus reported in Chile, including two deaths.Source: Published by the Ministry of Health of Chubut Province and reproduced by PAHO/WHOHealth authorities in Argentina and Chile are implementing the following public health measures:HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%.In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly Sigmodontinae species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to Andes virus in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation. Standard precautions1 should always be put in place, as well as rodent control measures.PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus.Particular attention should be paid towards travelers returning from the affected areas. Early identification and timely medical care greatly improves clinical outcomes. To raise awareness regarding potential HPS cases, clinicians should consult epidemiological data for guidance of the possible exposure, and be vigilant of patients presenting with suspicious clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia.Care during the initial stages of the disease should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICU).Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, is not approved for either treatment or prophylaxis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infection.Health awareness campaigns must aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people\u2019s exposure. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. Most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposure of travelers to rodents or their excreta. However, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking, should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials.HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. The implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations, is recommended.References:1 Standard precautions refer to a set of practices that are applied to the care of patients, regardless of the state of infection (suspicion or confirmation), in any place where health services are provided. These practices aim to protect both healthcare professionals and patients and include: hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, safe handling of sharps materials, safe injection practices, use of sterile instruments and equipment and cleaning of hospital environments and the environment.

Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 October 2018 to 7 January 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 \u201cfacility-based\u201d deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM+) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked case. The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo-Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants), and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants), in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared to the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants.In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under five years at 35%, 5-9 years at 22% and 10-14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged nine months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under five (47%) in the African region which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection.The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe.The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country\u2014which reoccurs seasonally\u2014straining the public health response.The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public Health response measures include:Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection.WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection.The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low.WHO urges all Member States to:WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and or trade to Madagascar based on the information available on the current outbreak.For more information on Measles, please see the link below:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Measles"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Madagascar", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON119", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-17", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible.

Details of these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).From 2012 through 31 December 2018, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2 279 with 806 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel\u2019s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON114", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-10", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "10 January 2019WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible.

Nevertheless, WHO and partners remain committed, under the government\u2019s leadership and through collaboration across agencies, to addressing challenges and ending the outbreak.As of 8 January 2019, there have been a total of 628 EVD cases1 (580 confirmed and 48 probable), including 383 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 222 people have recovered, been discharged from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors.During the last 21 days (19 December 2018 to 8 January 2019), cases have been reported from ten health zones where the outbreak remains active, including: Katwa (18), Butembo (16), Oicha (13), Beni (13), Kalungata (6), Mabalako (5), Komanda (3), Musienene (2), Kyondo (1) and Nyankunde (1). Overall, cases have occurred in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 1). Surveillance activities are being maintained to rapidly detect resurgences or reintroduction events in all areas.Trends in numbers of new cases occurring (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with encouraging declines in case incidence in areas such as Beni. Hard-earned progress could still be lost from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.Amongst confirmed and probable EVD cases, 61% (385/628) were female and 30% (189/628) were children aged less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than 1 year (38) and 1-4 years (58). While investigations to understand the risk factors for this disproportionate burden are ongoing, response teams continue to prioritise these population groups to mitigate, wherever possible, the risk of transmission.All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and in a traveller returning from Burundi to Sweden. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. International travellers who may have come into contact with the virus, including a doctor who returned to the United States of America after providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also being followed closely; all remain asymptomatic.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, see:1Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/09-january-2019-yellow-fever-nigeria-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-09", "headline": "Yellow fever - Nigeria", "main_text": "9 January 2019On 22 November 2018, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of suspected Yellow fever (YF) cases and deaths in Edo State, Nigeria. Edo State is located less than 400km from Lagos on a dense population movement axis between Lagos and South-Eastern Nigeria. Edo State is also a known endemic area for Lassa fever \u2013 which was initially suspected as causing the outbreak. From 22 September through 31 December 2018, a total of 146 suspected, 42 presumptive positive, and 32 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths (presumptive case fatality rate: 18%), have been reported across 15 of 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Edo State (figure 1).Blood specimens were obtained from 122 cases and sent for laboratory diagnosis; 42 (34%) samples were presumptive positive in-country based on IgM serology and sent to the regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), for confirmation. Thirty-two (76%) were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Males represent the majority of cases (108 of 146, 74%), and the most affected age group is 10\u201319 years with 48 cases (33%), followed by the age group 20\u201329 with 36 cases (25%). Initially, the affected LGAs were rural but since the end of November 2018, suspected cases have been reported from three urban LGAs. There has also been a report of two presumptive positive and one confirmed case in Oredo LGA, which includes the densely populated state capital Benin City, of about 1.5 million inhabitants.At the time of the outbreak, population immunity in Edo State was very low, (based solely on routine immunisation administrative data, with vaccine coverage estimated at less than 50% in 2018). Edo State has just concluded a seven-day YF Reactive Vaccination Campaign implementation in 13 LGAs to rapidly boost population immunity and interrupt YF transmission. As of 31 December 2018, 1.47 million people have been vaccinated.Entomological studies have revealed elevated indices of competent vectors, including Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species responsible for rapid amplification of arboviral disease in urban environments. Land-use practices, namely cultivation close to dwellings, may further exacerbate the spread of YF disease in this setting.Since September 2017, when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) informed WHO of a confirmed case of YF in Kwara State, Nigeria has been responding to successive YF outbreaks. The country officially notified WHO (via the International Health Regulations, 2005) on 15 September 2017. Since then, and as of 30 December 2018, 237 specimens tested IgM positive in-country. Eighty-two cases (including 13 deaths) were confirmed by IPD; these cases were reported from 27 LGAs in 14 States and have resulted in response campaigns in selected LGAs in six states.The current outbreak of YF in Edo State in Nigeria is unusual in scale and severity, and the number of cases in time and place is very high in the context of the current national outbreak. The seasonal timing of the outbreak, in a period where many travellers enter the state from other states and countries for the holidays in December\u2013January, adds to the risk for potential spread.The response to the outbreak is being coordinated through a multi-agency, multi-partner Incident Management System (IMS). A national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to monitor the outbreak at the NCDC. Rapid response teams continue to support Edo State in ongoing outbreak investigation and response. YF surveillance has been intensified and active case finding is ongoing in affected LGAs and neighbouring states. Supervisory visits to the YF laboratory network are ongoing to strengthen laboratory capacity.The WHO Country Office and State Office have been actively monitoring and responding to the YF outbreak since the start of the outbreak. From 15 December 2018, three YF experts from WHO (WHO Regional Office for Africa and WHO headquarters) were deployed to support local authorities in investigating this event, assessing the risk of further amplification, and assisting in conducting reactive vaccination campaigns, among other activities. Entomological surveys were conducted in Anambra, Benue, Ekiti, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kwara, Rivers, and Zamfara states by entomologists from the National Arbovirus Research Institute (NARI). A vector control strategy, tailored to the local context, is being developed with the support of WHO regional and global vector control experts.Routine YF vaccination was introduced to Nigeria\u2019s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2004, but the overall population immunity in areas affected by the current outbreak remains below herd immunity thresholds. National preventive and reactive mass vaccination campaigns have been conducted in the country since 2017 (~33 million doses). A proposal has been submitted to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to vaccinate twelve states over the next three years (~23 million doses).The International Coordination Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance approved release of 3.1 million doses of YF vaccines. The country initiated a large scale reactive yellow fever vaccination campaign in Edo State on 18 December, initially using in-country vaccine stocks which were mobilised to facilitate a timely response before the holidays.YF is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.The YF outbreak has been active in Nigeria since September 2017. Cases are reported from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The recent confirmation by the regional reference laboratory of the YF outbreak in Edo State, with the probable epicentre in Uhunmwonde LGA, represents an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria. Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Edo State, the national risk is assessed as high due to: the high presumptive case fatality rate (33%) in Edo State; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to low vaccination coverage; presence of competent vectors including Aedes sp.; the proximity of a case to Benin City (major urban centre and capital of Edo State); and the potential spread to new LGAs.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries and particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors over the festive end of year season. The current overall risk is low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, monkey pox, measles, and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country.Nigeria is a high priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Phased preventive YF vaccination campaigns are planned to cover the entire country by 2024. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of YF. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement these interventions to control the current outbreak.WHO recommends vaccination against YF for all international travellers more than nine months of age going to Nigeria, as there is evidence of persistent or periodic YF virus transmission. Nigeria also requires a YF vaccination certificate for travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission.YF vaccines recommended by WHO are safe, highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005), Third edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against YF extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO approved vaccine. A booster dose of approved YF vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry.WHO encourages its Member States to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travellers should also be made aware of YF symptoms and signs and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of YF transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Nigeria on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.For more information on yellow fever please see:", "reports": {"diseases": ["Yellow fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Nigeria", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/08-january-2019-poliovirus-drc-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-08", "headline": "Poliomyelitis - Congo", "main_text": "8 January 2019As of October 2018, genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were detected in two cases from Haut-Katanga province (Mufunga-Sampwe district) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first case was a 11-year old child who experienced onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 6 October. The second case was a 29-month old child who experienced onset of symptoms on 7 October, and is a known contact of the first case. The isolated viruses are a new emergence and unrelated to previously-detected cVDPV2s affecting the country. This is the fourth distinct outbreak of cVDPV2 detected in the country since June 2017. In total, 42 cVDPV2 cases have now been confirmed since detection of the first outbreak in June 2017, 20 cases of which were detected in 2018.In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency. On 26 July 2018, the Minister of Health, WHO Director General, the Regional Director for Africa, and provincial governors convened an urgent, high-level meeting and signed the \u2018Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication\u2019. Provincial governors pledged to provide the necessary oversight, accountability and resources required to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. It is imperative that the remaining operational gaps in outbreak response are urgently filled with the appropriate oversight and engagement.WHO and partners are responding in accordance with international outbreak response protocols including through administration of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). However, operational gaps such as the under-immunization of high-risk populations, continue to hamper the full implementation of these protocols. Thus, the response so far has not adequately controlled the outbreak nor prevented its spread. The recent emergence of the fourth outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program\u2019s current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner.With the evidence of geographic spread of some of these strains and emergence of the new strain, two large scale rounds of mOPV2 were administered in September 2018 and October 2018 targeting around 12 million children in 16 of 26 provinces of the country. Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries.The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to the ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province to the east of the country. Polio outbreak response teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.Currently, WHO finds the overall national public health risk associated with these four outbreaks to be very high. The risk of international spread, particularly to the neighboring countries also remains high due to the continuation of these outbreaks close to international borders. This risk is magnified by known population movements between the affected areas of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, Zambia and South Sudan.As of July 2018, in light of the epidemiology of the reported polio cases, genetic analyses of the isolated polioviruses, risk of further in-country and international spread, and the country\u2019s response capacity, the outbreak has been graded as a Grade 2 public health emergency based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework.The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage to minimize the risk and consequences of poliovirus circulation. These events also highlight the risks posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is necessary to impede further disease transmission, ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas, and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to monitor and evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.WHO\u2019s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors staying for more than four- weeks in affected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. Efforts should also be made to ensure that individuals who received vaccinations are provided the appropriate documentation to record their vaccination status.As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency.At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of the information available for the current cVDPV2 outbreaks.Cross border activities should be conducted between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries to strengthen AFP surveillance and routine immunization as well as operations linked to the control of other vaccine preventable diseases. Direct and regular collaboration between neighboring provinces and districts should begin quickly awaiting formal administrative and political address.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Poliomyelitis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2019-DON113", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-04", "headline": "Ebola - Democratic Republic of the Congo", "main_text": "The response by WHO and partners to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues despite disruptions to key services due to security incidents taking place in Beni and Butembo during the recent election on 30 December 2018. In order to ensure the safety of all staff deployed, as a precautionary measure, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day. All normal operations have been fully restored as of 1 January 2019. After an intensification of field activities in early December, notable improvements can be observed in many areas, notably a decrease in cases in Beni. However, hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.During the reporting period (27 December 2018 \u2013 2 January 2019), 16 newly confirmed cases were reported from Beni (two), Butembo (five), Katwa (three), Komanda (one), Mabalako (one), and Oicha (four) health zones (Figure 1). As of 2 January 2019, there have been a total of 609 EVD cases1 (561 confirmed and 48 probable, Figure 2), including 370 deaths and 208 people having recovered. Overall, cases are occurring in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri. Amongst confirmed and probable cases, the case load has been highest in females aged 15-49 who are eligible for vaccination (i.e. non-pregnant), and also females aged 50 years and older (Figure 3). Amongst confirmed and probable cases, 61% (374/609) were female (median age = 28) and were predominantly older than male cases (median age = 25.5). Of note, 16% (96/607) of cases were among children less than five years old, and 7% (41/607) were infants less than one year old. Most of the cases among children aged five years old or more were from Beni, 48% (46/96). There were 29 cases among pregnant women, of which 14 were from Beni. Fifteen of the 29 cases were reportedly breastfeeding women.As of 2 January, a total of 86 cases of nosocomial infection were reported in patients from the general public, primarily from Beni (34), Butembo (13), Katwa (11) and Mabalako (eight). There have been no new cases in healthcare workers during this reporting period. To date, there have been a total of 55 EVD cases involving healthcare workers, of which 18 have died and eight were hospitalised as patients. Of the healthcare workers with available clinical information, 36% (18/50) died. Eleven healthcare workers were reportedly infected in a general hospital while the other 30 health facilities reported between one to three cases each during the entire outbreak period. It should be noted that 22% (133/609) of all cases had history of exposure to a hospital 1-21 days prior to the onset of their illness.Thorough contact tracing during initial case investigations remains difficult in light of continued community resistance and the deteriorating security situation in the field during the recent elections. This resulted in a number of new confirmed cases not being identified as potential contacts. Of all cases, 66% (327/495) had known contact with a case, and 37% (177/478) had attended a funeral. A sizeable proportion of cases, 34% (155/451), had both these exposures.The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the above mentioned outbreak affected areas.The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO\u2019s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, see:1Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/04-January-2019-hantavirus-panama-en", "date_of_publication": "2019-01-04", "headline": "Hantavirus disease - Panama", "main_text": "4 January 2019The Panama Ministry of Health has reported an increase in cases of hantavirus infection in Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama, to the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). Between 1 January and 22 December 2018, a total of 103 confirmed cases of hantavirus have been reported at the national level, 99 of which were reported in Los Santos Province. In Los Santos Province, 51 cases were classified as hantavirus fever1 (HF) without pulmonary syndrome and 48 cases were classified as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome2 (HPS), including four deaths.Cases were confirmed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. Sequencing determined that the type of virus associated with this outbreak is Choclo virus. It was first isolated in 1999 in the western Republic of Panama.Hantavirus cases have been reported in the Republic of Panama since 1999 (Figure 1). In the last five years, transmission has been documented in Los Santos, Herrera, Veraguas, and Cocle provinces. During 2018, cases have been reported in Los Santos (99 cases, Figure 2), Herrera (two cases), Cocle (one case) and Veraguas (one case) provinces (Figure 3). Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents and transmission can occur when people come in contact with rodent habitats, the current increase in hantavirus cases in the Republic of Panama could be related to changes in the abundance and distribution of rodent species, as well as strengthened surveillance and laboratory capacity at the provincial level. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends.Source: Provided by the Panama Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHOSource: Provided by the Panama Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHOSource: Provided by the Panama Ministry of Health and reproduced by PAHO/WHOThe public health responses currently being implemented include:HPS is a zoonotic, viral respiratory disease. The causative agent belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. Infections are acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with the excreta, droppings or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (forests, fields, farms, etc.), where rodents hosting the virus might be found. Infected individuals may experience headache, dizziness, chills, fever and myalgia. They may also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, and diarrhoea, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure, though symptoms may appear as early as one week to as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case fatality rate can reach 50%.In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. In January 2019, World Youth Day4 will be hosted in the Republic of Panama. This mass gathering will take place predominantly in Panama City, while side events will occur in other provinces5. Though a seasonal increase of hantavirus during the month of January has not been previously documented, increases in cases have been related to outdoor and agricultural activities in rural environments. Nevertheless, participants to the World Youth Day should be provided with recommendations and guidance on how to take appropriate precautionary measures to reduce their risk of infection. Health awareness campaigns for health personnel and the general public are planned for the coming weeks. Organisers and public health authorities should collaborate with travel and tourism sectors in placing educational materials and appropriate signage at strategic locations and points of entry (e.g. airports, public transport stations, travel agent offices). Alternative forms of media including public service announcements on planes, ships and public radio should also be considered.Based on current epidemiological data and public health response, WHO\u2019s risk assessment is that there is no significant risk of international spread of HPS in relation to this event.PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantavirus.Particular attention should be paid to travellers returning from the affected areas, who are advised to report their travel history, as early identification and timely medical care can improve clinical outcomes.Care during the initial stages of the illness should include antipyretics and analgesics as needed. In some situations, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while confirming the etiologic agent. Given the rapid progression of HPS, clinical management should focus on the patient's haemodynamic monitoring, fluid management, and ventilation support. Severe cases should be immediately transferred to intensive care units (ICUs).Health awareness campaigns should aim to increase detection and timely treatment of the illness and prevent its occurrence by reducing people\u2019s contact with rodents. Preventive measures should cover occupational and eco-tourism related hazards. While most usual tourism activities pose little or no risk of exposing travellers to rodents or their excreta, people who engage in outdoor activities such as camping or hiking should take precautions to reduce possible exposure to potentially infectious materials.HPS surveillance should be part of a comprehensive national surveillance system and must include clinical, laboratory and environmental components. WHO recommends the implementation of integrated environmental management, with the goal of reducing rodent populations. Throughout the World Youth Day event, syndromic surveillance may alert public authorities to increased influenza-like and GI symptoms among mass gathering participants.At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Republic of Panama based on available information for the current hantavirus outbreak.References:1 Hantavirus fever (HF): Cases who present with fever, myalgia, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and weakness.

While communities in affected areas are generally supportive of the Ebola response, operations in some areas have been temporarily disrupted due to insecurity. On 27 December 2018, protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit centre, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the centre temporarily withdrew and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment centre. WHO is concerned about the negative effects that the current insecurity is having on efforts to control the outbreak. After an intensification of field activities, marked improvements in controlling the outbreak were observed in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni. These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity that results in increased Ebola virus transmission. While maintaining focus on ending the outbreak and resuming normal operations as soon as possible, all response partners remain committed to ensuring the safety of staff. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and will adapt their response as needed.As of 26 December 2018, a total of 591 EVD cases, including 543 confirmed and 48 probable cases, have been reported from 16 health zones in the two neighbouring provinces of North Kivu and Ituri (Figure 1). Of these cases, 54 were healthcare workers, of which 18 died. Overall, 357 cases have died (case fatality ratio 60%). In the past week, ten additional patients were discharged from Ebola treatment centres; overall, 203 patients have recovered to date. The highest number of cases were from age group 15\u201249 years with 60% (355/589) of the cases, and of those, 228 were female. Highest attack rates have been observed in children aged more than one year (especially male infants) and females aged 15 years and older.Trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas. The general decrease in the weekly incidence observed in Beni since late October continued; however, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters have emerged in other health zones. Thirteen health zones reported a total of 109 confirmed cases in the last 21 days (5\u201226 December 2018). The majority of which were concentrated in major urban centres and towns in Katwa (26), Komanda (21), Mabalako (15), Beni (14) and Butembo (10) health zones. An isolated case was also recently detected in Nyankunde Health Zone \u2013 a newly affected area in Ituri Province \u2013 whom likely acquired the infection in Komanda. This case, highlights the continued high risk of continued spread of the outbreak and the need to strengthen all aspects of the response in Ituri, North Kivu and surrounding provinces and countries.The MoH, WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the abovementioned outbreak affected areas.*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning \u2013 trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO\u2019s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.For more information, see:1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Ebola virus disease "], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/28-december-2018-mers-saudi-arabia-en", "date_of_publication": "2018-12-28", "headline": "2018 - Saudi Arabia", "main_text": "28 December 2018From 31 October through 30 November 2018, the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported eight additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including two deaths. Details of these cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).From 2012 through 30 November 2018, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2274 with 806 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals, animal products (for example, following contact with camels), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": {"diseases": ["Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) "], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": ""}]}}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/27-december-2018-typhoid-pakistan-en", "date_of_publication": "2018-12-27", "headline": "2018 - Pakistan", "main_text": "27 December 2018Pakistan Health Authorities have reported an ongoing outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid fever that began in the Hyderabad district of Sindh province in November 2016. An increasing trend of typhoid fever cases caused by antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (or S. Typhi) poses a notable public health concern. In May 2018, the case definitions for non-resistant, multi-drug resistant (MDR) and XDR typhoid fever were formally agreed by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU) in Karachi, following a review by an expert group of epidemiologists, clinicians and microbiologists from Pakistan. All typhoid fever cases reported from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed and classified according to these case definitions (see Table 1).From 1 November 2016 through 9 December 2018, 5 274 cases of XDR typhoid out of 8 188 typhoid fever cases were reported by the Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PDSRU) in Sindh province, Pakistan. Sixty-nine percent of cases were reported in Karachi (the capital city), 27% in Hyderabad district, and 4% in other districts in the province (Table 2). The circulating XDR strain of S. Typhi haplotype 58 was resistant to first and second-line antibiotics as well as third generation cephalosporins. Informal reports of XDR typhoid cases occurring in other parts of Pakistan were made and required further verification.In addition, from January to October 2018, there were reports indicating international transmission of the XDR typhoid strain through persons who had travelled to Pakistan. Six travel-associated cases of XDR typhoid were reported; one in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and five in the United States of America. Four of the travel-associated cases had visited or resided in Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore (Punjab province) and/or Islamabad in Pakistan. Details regarding these four cases are as follows:Limited information is available about their mechanism of exposure or the exact date of onset of illness for these cases but, there are evidence that all the travel-associated cases were successfully treated.In January 2017, the Government of Pakistan initiated a public health response to the increasing number of XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh province. The resulting activities included:WHO has been leading initiatives to make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These initiatives include:The risk of XDR S. Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever. The fact that AMR S. Typhi confirmatory testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is only conducted by major laboratories and tertiary care hospitals are other priority considerations in terms of risk. These factors, coupled with sub-optimal antibiotic prescribing practices, have limited the ability to track the occurrence, spread, and containment of XDR S. Typhi.Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone-resistant S. Typhi have been reported in several countries. However, this is the first time a large outbreak caused by XDR S. Typhi has been observed in Pakistan.The risk at regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread over-use of anti-microbials which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region.Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices. However, S. Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated. The high level of resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all three levels.This outbreak highlights the importance of public health measures to prevent the spread of resistant and non-resistant pathogens. While the emerging resistance in S. Typhi complicates treatment, typhoid fever remains common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are the main and most important recommendations.WHO recommends typhoid vaccination in response to confirmed outbreaks of typhoid fever, and travelers to typhoid-endemic areas should consider vaccination. Further, where the TCV is licensed, WHO recommends TCV as the preferred typhoid vaccine. Typhoid vaccination should be implemented in combination with other efforts to control the disease.In view of the observed capacity for S. Typhi to quickly acquire new resistance mechanisms, WHO recommends strengthening surveillance of typhoid fever, including surveillance of AMR to monitor known resistance, detect new and emerging resistance, and mitigate its spread. WHO also recommends that surveillance data is shared locally and internationally in a timely manner.Currently, azithromycin is the only remaining reliable and affordable first-line oral therapeutic option to manage patients with XDR typhoid in low-resource settings. Patients with suspected typhoid fever should be tested microbiologically to detect S. Typhi and define antimicrobial susceptibility wherever possible to inform patient management and contribute to the surveillance efforts. Verification and advanced testing (including molecular methods) of S. Typhi strains with unusual resistance should be performed by designated expert laboratories that provide confirmatory testing, where such capacity exists within countries. In countries where no laboratory capacity currently exists, regional collaboration may be an option, whereby a neighbouring country\u2019s reference laboratory or a WHO Collaborating Center can fulfill this role.1 Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole2 Cefixime is recommended by the International Academy of the Philippines (IAP) for uncomplicated typhoid fever. Ceftriaxone is recommended for complicated typhoid fever.3 Fluoroquinolones4 First and second-line drugs, and third generation cephalosporins5 http://www.nih.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AMR-National-Action-Plan-Pakistan.pdf", "reports": {"diseases": ["Typhoid fever "], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"country": "Pakistan", "location": ""}]}}]
